			<p class="body-text">“As for the doubt of the physical mind as to whether the thing is possible, who has not had it? In my own case it pursued me years and years and it is only in the last two years that the last shadow of doubt, not latterly of its theoretical feasibility, but of the practical certainty of its achievement in the present state of the world and of the human nature, entirely left me. The same can be said of the egoistic poise, – that almost all strong men have the strong egoistic poise.” (<span class="ref-numbers- _idGenCharOverride-1">360</span>)</p>
