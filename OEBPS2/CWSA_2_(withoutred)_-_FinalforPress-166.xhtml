			<p class="body-text">“There can be no <a id="_idIndexMarker607"></a><span class="Index">immortality</span> of the body without supramentalisation; the potentiality is there in the Yogic force and Yogis can live for <span class="ref-numbers- _idGenCharOverride-1">200</span> or <span class="ref-numbers- _idGenCharOverride-1">300</span> years or more, but there can be no real principle of it without the Supramental.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Even Science believes that one day death may be conquered by physical means and its reasonings are perfectly sound. There is no reason why the Supramental Force should not do it. Forms on earth do not last (they do in other planes) because these forms are too rigid to grow expressing the progress of the spirit. If they become plastic enough to do that, there is no reason why they should not last.” (<span class="ref-numbers- _idGenCharOverride-1">313</span>)</p>
