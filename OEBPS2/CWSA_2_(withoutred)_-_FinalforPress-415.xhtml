			<p class="body-text">“You sent a message about an “Aurobindo Math” which seemed to show you had caught the contagion which rages in Bengal. You must understand that my mission is not to create maths, ascetics and Sannyasis; but to call back the souls of the strong to the Lila of Krishna &amp; Kali. That is my teaching, as you can see from the Review, and my name must never be connected with monastic forms or the monastic ideal. Every ascetic movement since the time of Buddha has left India weaker and for a very obvious reason. Renunciation of life is one thing, to make life itself, national, individual, <a id="_idIndexMarker1095"></a><span class="Index">world-life</span> greater &amp; more divine is another. You cannot enforce one ideal on the country without weakening the other. You cannot take away the best souls from life &amp; yet leave life stronger &amp; greater. Renunciation of ego, acceptance of God in life is the Yoga I teach, – no other renunciation.” (<span class="ref-numbers- _idGenCharOverride-1">222</span>)</p>
