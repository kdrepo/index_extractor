			<p class="body-text">“It is your <a id="_idIndexMarker831"></a><span class="Index">psychic being</span> which came in front, probably, or else it is the true vital being in you which was able to come in front because you took the psychic attitude. When the psychic being comes in front, then there is an automatic perception of the true and untrue, the divine and the undivine, the spiritual right and wrong of things and the false vital and mental movements and attacks are immediately exposed and fall away and can do nothing; gradually the vital and physical as well as the mind get full of this psychic light and truth and sound feeling and purity and such violent attacks as you have are impossible. When the true vital being comes forward, it is something wide and strong and calm, an unmoved and powerful warrior for the Divine and the Truth repelling all enemies, bringing in a true strength and force and opening the vital to the greater Consciousness above. It has to be seen which of the two it is you feel within you.” (<span class="ref-numbers- _idGenCharOverride-1">356</span>-<span class="ref-numbers- _idGenCharOverride-1">57</span>)</p>
