			<h2 id="_idParaDest-141" class="SubHead1">The Two Aspects of the <a id="_idIndexMarker520"></a><span class="Index">True Being</span></h2>
			<p class="body-text">“The true being may be realised in one or both of two aspects – the Self or Atman and the soul or antarātman, psychic being or caitya puruṣa. The difference is that one is felt as universal, the other as individual supporting the mind, life and body. When one first realises the Atman one feels it separate from all things, existing in itself and detached, and it is to this realisation that the image of the dry coconut fruit may apply. When one realises the psychic being, it is not like that; for this brings the sense of union with the Divine and dependence upon it and sole consecration to the Divine alone and the power to change the nature and discover the true mental, the true vital, the true physical being in oneself. Both realisations are necessary for this Yoga.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The “I” or the little ego is constituted by Nature and is at once a mental, vital and physical formation meant to aid in centralising and individualising the outer consciousness and action. When the true being is discovered, the utility of the ego is over and this formation has to disappear – the true being is felt in its place.” (<span class="ref-numbers- _idGenCharOverride-1">97</span>)</p>
