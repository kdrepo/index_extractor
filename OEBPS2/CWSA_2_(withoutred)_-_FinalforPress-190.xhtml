			<h2 id="_idParaDest-190" class="SubHead1">Kalki Avatar and the Value of the Exact Puranic Figures about the Length of the Various Yugas</h2>
			<p class="body-text">“Too much importance need not be attached to the details about <a id="_idIndexMarker693"></a><span class="Index">Kalki</span> – they are rather symbolic than an attempt to prophesy details of future history. What is expressed is something that has to come, but it is symbolically indicated, no more.</p>
			<p class="body-text">So too, too much weight need not be put on the exact figures about the <a id="_idIndexMarker694"></a><span class="Index">Yugas</span> in the Purana. Here again the Kala and the Yugas indicate successive periods in the cyclic wheel of evolution, the perfect state, decline and disintegration of successive ages of humanity followed by a new birth – the mathematical calculations are not the important element. The argument of the end of the Kali Yuga already come or coming and a new Satya Yuga coming is a very familiar one and there have been many who have upheld it.” (<span class="ref-numbers- _idGenCharOverride-1">489</span>)</p>
