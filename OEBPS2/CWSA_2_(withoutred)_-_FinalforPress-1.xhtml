			<h2 id="_idParaDest-1" class="SubHead1">All Life Is Yoga</h2>
			<p class="body-text">“In the right view both of life and of Yoga all life is either consciously or subconsciously a <a id="_idIndexMarker000"></a><span class="Index">Yoga</span>. For we mean by this term a methodised effort towards <a id="_idIndexMarker001"></a><span class="Index">self-perfection</span> by the expression of the secret potentialities latent in the being and – highest condition of victory in that effort – a union of the human individual with the universal and transcendent Existence we see partially expressed in man and in the Cosmos. But all life, when we look behind its appearances, is a vast Yoga of Nature who attempts in the conscious and the subconscious to realise her perfection in an ever-increasing expression of her yet unrealised potentialities and to unite herself with her own divine reality. In man, her thinker, she for the first time upon this Earth devises self-conscious means and willed arrangements of activity by which this great purpose may be more swiftly and puissantly attained. Yoga, as Swami <a id="_idIndexMarker002"></a>Vivekananda has said, may be regarded as a means of compressing one’s evolution into a single life or a few years or even a few months of bodily existence. A given system of Yoga, then, can be no more than a selection or a compression, into narrower but more energetic forms of intensity, of the general methods which are already being used loosely, largely, in a leisurely movement, with a profuser apparent waste of material and energy but with a more complete combination by the great Mother in her vast upward labour.” (<span class="ref-numbers- _idGenCharOverride-1">6</span>)</p>
