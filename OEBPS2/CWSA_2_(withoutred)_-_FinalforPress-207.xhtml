			<p class="body-text">“The Divine gives itself to those who give themselves without reserve and in all their parts to the Divine. For them the calm, the light, the power, the bliss, the freedom, the wideness, the heights of knowledge, the seas of Ananda.” (<span class="ref-numbers- _idGenCharOverride-1">67</span>)</p>

			<p class="body-text">“Surrender means to consecrate everything in oneself to the Divine, to offer all one is and has, not to insist on one’s ideas, desires, habits etc., but to allow the divine Truth to replace them by its knowledge, will and action everywhere.” (<span class="ref-numbers- _idGenCharOverride-1">67</span>)</p>
			<p class="star-single-center">***</p>
			<p class="body-text">“The Divine can lead, he does not drive. There is an internal freedom permitted to every mental being called man to assent or not to assent to the Divine leading – how else can any real spiritual evolution be done?” (<span class="ref-numbers- _idGenCharOverride-1">68</span>)</p>
