			<p class="savitri-text">“Overpassed were the leaden formulas of the Mind,<br />Overpowered the obstacle of mortal Space:<br />The unfolding Image showed the things to come.<br />A giant dance of Shiva tore the past;<br />There was a thunder as of worlds that fall;<br />Earth was o’errun with fire and the roar of Death<br />Clamouring to slay a world his hunger had made;<br />There was a clangour of Destruction’s wings:<br />The Titan’s battle-cry was in my ears,<br />Alarm and rumour shook the armoured Night.<br />I saw the Omnipotent’s flaming pioneers<br />Over the heavenly verge which turns towards life<br />Come crowding down the amber stairs of birth;<br />Forerunners of a divine multitude,<br />Out of the paths of the morning star they came<br />Into the little room of mortal life.<br />I saw them cross the twilight of an age,<br />The <a id="_idIndexMarker1011"></a><span class="Index">sun-eyed children</span> of a marvellous dawn,<br />The great creators with wide brows of calm,<br />The massive barrier-breakers of the world<br />And wrestlers with destiny in her lists of will,<br />The labourers in the quarries of the gods,<br />The messengers of the Incommunicable,<br />The architects of immortality.<br />Into the fallen human sphere they came,<br />Faces that wore the Immortal’s glory still,<br />Voices that communed still with the thoughts of God,<br />Bodies made beautiful by the spirit’s light,<br />Carrying the magic word, the mystic fire,<br />Carrying the Dionysian cup of joy,<br />Approaching eyes of a diviner man,<br />Lips chanting an unknown anthem of the soul,<br />Feet echoing in the corridors of Time.<br />High priests of wisdom, sweetness, might and bliss,<br />Discoverers of beauty’s sunlit ways<br />And swimmers of Love’s laughing fiery floods<br />And dancers within rapture’s golden doors,<br />Their tread one day shall change the suffering earth<br />And justify the light on Nature’s face.<br />Although Fate lingers in the high Beyond<br />And the work seems vain on which our heart’s force was spent,<br />All shall be done for which our pain was borne.<br />Even as of old man came behind the beast<br />This high divine successor surely shall come<br />Behind man’s inefficient mortal pace,<br />Behind his vain labour, sweat and blood and tears:<br />He shall know what mortal mind barely durst think,<br />He shall do what the heart of the mortal could not dare.” (<span class="ref-numbers- _idGenCharOverride-1">343</span>-<span class="ref-numbers- _idGenCharOverride-1">44</span>)</p>
