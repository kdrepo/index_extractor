			<p class="body-text">“The forces and beings of the vital world have a great influence on human beings. The vital world is on one side a world of beauty, – the poet, artist, musician are in close contact with it; it is also a world of powers and passions, lusts and desires, – our own lusts and desires, and passions and ambitions can put us into connection with the vital worlds and their forces and beings. It is again a world of things dark, dangerous and horrible. <a id="_idIndexMarker547"></a><span class="Index">Nightmares</span> like X’s are contacts with this side of the vital plane. Its influences are also the source of much in men that is demoniac, dirty, cruel and base.” (<span class="ref-numbers- _idGenCharOverride-1">128</span>)</p>
