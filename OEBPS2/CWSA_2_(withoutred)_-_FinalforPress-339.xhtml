			<p class="savitri-text">“He sang of the glory and marvel still to be born,<br />Of Godhead throwing off at last its veil,<br />Of bodies made divine and life made bliss,<br />Immortal sweetness clasping immortal might,<br />Heart sensing heart, thought looking straight at thought,<br />And the delight when every barrier falls,<br />And the transfiguration and the ecstasy.<br />And as he sang the demons wept with joy<br />Foreseeing the end of their long dreadful task<br />And the defeat for which they hoped in vain,<br />And glad release from their self-chosen doom<br />And return into the One from whom they came.” (<span class="ref-numbers- _idGenCharOverride-1">416</span>-<span class="ref-numbers- _idGenCharOverride-1">17</span>)</p>
