			<p class="body-text">“The mantra as I have tried to describe it in The Future Poetry is a word of power and light that comes from the Overmind inspiration or from some very high plane of Intuition. Its characteristics are a language that conveys infinitely more than the mere surface sense of the words seems to indicate, a rhythm that means even more than the language and is born out of the Infinite and disappears into it, and the power to convey not merely the mental, vital or physical contents or indications or values of the thing uttered, but its significance and figure in some fundamental and original consciousness which is behind all these and greater. The passages you mention from the Upanishad and the Gita have certainly the Overmind accent. But ordinarily the <a id="_idIndexMarker407"></a><span class="Index">Overmind inspiration</span> does not come out pure in human poetry – it has to come down to an inferior consciousness and touch it or else to lift it by a seizure and surprise from above into some infinite largeness. There is always a mixture of the two elements, not an absolute transformation though the higher may sometimes dominate. You must remember that the Overmind is a superhuman consciousness and to be able to write always or purely from an overmind inspiration would mean the elevation of at least a part of the nature beyond the human level.” <span class="ref-numbers- _idGenCharOverride-1">22</span> June <span class="ref-numbers- _idGenCharOverride-1">1931</span> (<span class="ref-numbers- _idGenCharOverride-1">26</span>-<span class="ref-numbers- _idGenCharOverride-1">27</span>)</p>
