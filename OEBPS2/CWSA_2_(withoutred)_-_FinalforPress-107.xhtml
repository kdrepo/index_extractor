			<h2 id="_idParaDest-107" class="SubHead1">Joy of <a id="_idIndexMarker402"></a><span class="Index">Poetic Creation</span>*</h2>
			<p class="body-text">“Poetry takes its start from any plane of the consciousness, but, like all art, one might even say all creation, it must be passed through the vital, the life-soul, gather from it a certain force for manifestation if it is to be itself alive. And as there is always a joy in creation, that joy along with a certain enthousiasmos – not enthusiasm, if you please, but an invasion and exultation of creative force and creative ecstasy, ānandamaya āveśa – must always be there, whatever the source. But where the inspiration comes from the linking of the vital creative instrument to a deeper psychic experience, that imparts another kind of intensive originality and peculiar individual power, a subtle and delicate perfection, a linking on to something that is at once fine to etheriality and potent, intense as fire yet full of sweetness. But this is exceedingly rare in its absolute quality, – poetry as an expression of mind and life is common, poetry of the mind and life touched by the soul and given a spiritual fineness is to be found but more rare; the pure psychic note in poetry breaks through only once in a way, in a brief lyric, a sudden line, a luminous passage. It was indeed because this linking-on took place that the true poetic faculty suddenly awoke in you, – for it was not there before, at least on the surface. The joy you feel, therefore, was no doubt partly the simple joy of creation, but there comes also into it the joy of expression of the psychic being which was seeking for an outlet since your boyhood. It is this inner expression that makes the writing of poetry a part of sadhana.” <span class="ref-numbers- _idGenCharOverride-1">29</span> May <span class="ref-numbers- _idGenCharOverride-1">1931</span> (<span class="ref-numbers- _idGenCharOverride-1">9</span>-<span class="ref-numbers- _idGenCharOverride-1">10</span>)</p>
