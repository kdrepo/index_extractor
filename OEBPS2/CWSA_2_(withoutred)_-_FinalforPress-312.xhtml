			<p class="savitri-text">“This knowledge first he had of time-born men.<br />Admitted through a curtain of bright mind<br />That hangs between our thoughts and absolute sight,<br />He found the occult cave, the mystic door<br />Near to the well of vision in the soul,<br />And entered where the Wings of Glory brood<br />In the silent space where all is for ever known.<br />Indifferent to doubt and to belief,<br />Avid of the naked real’s single shock<br />He shore the cord of mind that ties the earth-heart<br />And cast away the yoke of Matter’s law.<br />The body’s rules bound not the spirit’s powers:<br />When life had stopped its beats, death broke not in;<br />He dared to live when breath and thought were still.<br />Thus could he step into that magic place<br />Which few can even glimpse with hurried glance<br />Lifted for a moment from mind’s laboured works<br />And the poverty of Nature’s earthly sight.<br />All that the Gods have learned is there self-known.<br />There in a hidden chamber closed and mute<br />Are kept the record graphs of the cosmic scribe,<br />And there the tables of the sacred Law,<br />There is the Book of Being’s index page;<br />The text and glossary of the Vedic truth<br />Are there; the rhythms and metres of the stars<br />Significant of the movements of our fate:<br />The symbol powers of number and of form,<br />And the secret code of the history of the world<br />And Nature’s correspondence with the soul<br />Are written in the mystic heart of Life.<br />In the glow of the spirit’s room of memories<br />He could recover the luminous marginal notes<br />Dotting with light the crabbed ambiguous scroll,<br />Rescue the preamble and the saving clause<br />Of the dark Agreement by which all is ruled<br />That rises from material Nature’s sleep<br />To clothe the Everlasting in new shapes.” (<span class="ref-numbers- _idGenCharOverride-1">74</span>-<span class="ref-numbers- _idGenCharOverride-1">75</span>)</p>
