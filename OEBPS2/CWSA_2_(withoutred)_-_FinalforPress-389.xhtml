			<p class="body-text">“I have no intention, I can assure you, of cutting off connection in the future. What restrictions there have been, were due to unavoidable causes. My retirement itself was indispensable; otherwise I would not now be where I am, that is, personally near the goal. When the goal is reached, things will be different. But as far as you are concerned, I have given to you what I have not given to others; what you have quoted about my connection with you is perfectly true; if it were false, why should I have persistently pressed you to remain with me always? Inwardly, I have been constant in my desire and my effort to help you, not only from time to time, but daily and always. If you had an unprecedented peace for so long a time, it was due to my persistent inner pressure; I refuse to give up all the credit to my double, Krishna.” <span class="ref-numbers- _idGenCharOverride-1">14</span> August <span class="ref-numbers- _idGenCharOverride-1">1945</span> (<span class="ref-numbers- _idGenCharOverride-1">366</span>-<span class="ref-numbers- _idGenCharOverride-1">67</span>)</p>
