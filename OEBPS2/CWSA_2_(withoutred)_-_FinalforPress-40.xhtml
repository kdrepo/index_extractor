			<p class="body-text">“It is not possible for the tongue of human speech to tell all the utter unity and all the eternal variety of the ananda of divine love. Our higher and our lower members are both flooded with it, the mind and life no less than the soul: even the physical body takes its share of the joy, feels the touch, is filled in all its limbs, veins, nerves with the flowing of the wine of the ecstasy, amṛta. <a id="_idIndexMarker133"></a><span class="Index">Love</span> and <a id="_idIndexMarker134"></a><span class="Index">Ananda</span> are the last word of being, the secret of secrets, the mystery of mysteries.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Thus universalised, personalised, raised to its intensities, made all-occupying, all-embracing, all-fulfilling, the way of love and delight gives the supreme liberation. Its highest crest is a supracosmic union. But for love complete union is <a id="_idIndexMarker135"></a><span class="Index">mukti</span>; liberation has to it no other sense; and it includes all kinds of mukti together, nor are they in the end, as some would have it, merely successive to each other and therefore mutually exclusive. We have the absolute union of the divine with the human spirit, <a id="_idIndexMarker136"></a><span class="Index">s</span><span class="Index">ā</span><span class="Index">yujya</span>; in that reveals itself a content of all that depends here upon difference, – but there the difference is only a form of oneness, – ananda too of nearness and contact and mutual presence, <a id="_idIndexMarker137"></a><span class="Index">s</span><span class="Index">ā</span><span class="Index">m</span><span class="Index">ī</span><span class="Index">pya</span>, <a id="_idIndexMarker138"></a><span class="Index">s</span><span class="Index">ā</span><span class="Index">lokya</span>, ananda of mutual reflection, the thing that we call likeness, <a id="_idIndexMarker139"></a><span class="Index">s</span><span class="Index">ā</span><span class="Index">d</span><span class="Index">ṛś</span><span class="Index">ya</span>, and other wonderful things too for which language has as yet no name. There is nothing which is beyond the reach of the God-lover or denied to him; for he is the favourite of the divine Lover and the self of the Beloved.” (<span class="ref-numbers- _idGenCharOverride-1">605</span>-<span class="ref-numbers- _idGenCharOverride-1">06</span>)</p>
