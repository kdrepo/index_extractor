			<p class="body-text">“In the sphere of the Spirit are only the eternal truths – all is eternally itself there, there is no development, nothing unrealised or striving to be fulfilled. There are no such things as possibilities therefore.</p>
			<p class="body-text">In life on the other hand all is a play of possibilities – nothing is realised, all is seeking to be realised – or if not yet seeking, then waiting behind the veil for that. Nothing is realised in its highest form, in its truth or completeness, but all is possible. All these possibilities are derived from the truths above – e.g., the possibility of knowledge, the possibility of love, the possibility of joy etc.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Intellect, will etc. are intermediaries which try to catch something of the hidden higher truths and bring them into life or else raise life to them – so that the possibilities of life here may become the complete realities that are already there above.” (<span class="ref-numbers- _idGenCharOverride-1">29</span>)</p>
