			<p class="questions">“Up till now, I have not recognised the divinity of anyone except Sri Krishna. I have looked on the Mother as a Guru who can take me to him. But now something in me wants to hold the Mother fast as divinity. I can’t keep her out of my mind, nor can I reject Sri Krishna. The more I think, the more I am perplexed. I pray for your help.</p>
			<p class="body-text">This struggle in you (between bhakti for Sri Krishna and the sense of the divinity of the Mother) is quite unnecessary; for the two things are one and go perfectly together. It is he who has brought you to the Mother and it is by adoration of her that you will realise him. He is here in the <a id="_idIndexMarker985"></a><span class="Index">Asram</span> and it is his work that is being done here.” <span class="ref-numbers- _idGenCharOverride-1">2</span> March <span class="ref-numbers- _idGenCharOverride-1">1932</span> (<span class="ref-numbers- _idGenCharOverride-1">337</span>)</p>
