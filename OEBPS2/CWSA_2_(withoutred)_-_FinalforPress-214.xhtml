			<p class="body-text">“It has always been said that to take disciples means to take upon yourself the difficulties of the disciples as well as your own. Of course, if the Guru does not identify himself with the disciple, does not take him into his own consciousness, keeps him outside and only gives him upadeśa, leaving him to do the rest himself, then the chance of these effects is much diminished, made practically nil.” (<span class="ref-numbers- _idGenCharOverride-1">197</span>)</p>
