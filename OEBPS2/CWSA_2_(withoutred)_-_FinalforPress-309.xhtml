			<p class="savitri-text">“The master of existence lurks in us<br />And plays at hide-and-seek with his own Force;<br />In Nature’s instrument loiters secret God.<br />The Immanent lives in man as in his house;<br />He has made the universe his pastime’s field,<br />A vast gymnasium of his works of might.<br />All-knowing he accepts our darkened state,<br />Divine, wears shapes of animal or man;<br />Eternal, he assents to Fate and Time,<br />Immortal, dallies with mortality.<br />The All-Conscious ventured into Ignorance,<br />The All-Blissful bore to be insensible.<br />Incarnate in a world of strife and pain,<br />He puts on joy and sorrow like a robe<br />And drinks experience like a strengthening wine.<br />He whose transcendence rules the pregnant Vasts,<br />Prescient now dwells in our subliminal depths,<br />A luminous individual Power, alone.” (<span class="ref-numbers- _idGenCharOverride-1">66</span>-<span class="ref-numbers- _idGenCharOverride-1">67</span>)</p>
