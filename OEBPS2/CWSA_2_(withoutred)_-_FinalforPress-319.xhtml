			<p class="savitri-text">“To her possessor in the field of Time<br />A single splendour caught from her glory seems<br />The one true light, her beauty’s glowing whole.<br />But thought nor word can seize eternal Truth:<br />The whole world lives in a lonely ray of her sun.<br />In our thinking’s close and narrow lamp-lit house<br />The vanity of our shut mortal mind<br />Dreams that the chains of thought have made her ours;<br />But only we play with our own brilliant bonds;<br />Tying her down, it is ourselves we tie.<br />In our hypnosis by one luminous point<br />We see not what small figure of her we hold;<br />We feel not her inspiring boundlessness,<br />We share not her immortal liberty.<br />Thus is it even with the seer and sage;<br />For still the human limits the divine:<br />Out of our thoughts we must leap up to sight,<br />Breathe her divine illimitable air,<br />Her simple vast supremacy confess,<br />Dare to surrender to her absolute.<br />Then the Unmanifest reflects his form<br />In the still mind as in a living glass;<br />The timeless Ray descends into our hearts<br />And we are rapt into eternity.<br />For Truth is wider, greater than her forms.<br />A thousand icons they have made of her<br />And find her in the idols they adore;<br />But she remains herself and infinite.” (<span class="ref-numbers- _idGenCharOverride-1">275</span>-<span class="ref-numbers- _idGenCharOverride-1">76</span>)</p>
