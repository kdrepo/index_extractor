			<p class="questions">“When I read the speeches you delivered before <span class="ref-numbers- _idGenCharOverride-4">1910</span>, it seems to me as if Gandhi had almost copied everything from that – Swaraj, Samiti, Non-cooperation, and so on. If not outwardly he must have received these things from you in an occult way.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The whole of Gandhi’s affair is simply our passive resistance movement given an ethical instead of a political form, applied with a rigid thoroughness which human nature except in a minority cannot bear for long and given too a twist which seems to me to make it harmful to the sane balance and many-sided plasticity necessary for national life. What with Gandhi, Hitler and the rest (very different people but all furiously one-sided and one-ideaed) a large part of humanity seems to have gone off its balance in these times.” <span class="ref-numbers- _idGenCharOverride-1">21</span> September <span class="ref-numbers- _idGenCharOverride-1">1934</span> (<span class="ref-numbers- _idGenCharOverride-1">18</span>)</p>
