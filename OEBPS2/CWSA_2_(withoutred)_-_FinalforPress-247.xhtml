			<p class="body-text">“All that [vanity, jealousy, the sense of not being loved] of course is not love, but self-love. Jealousy is only an ugly form of <a id="_idIndexMarker851"></a><span class="Index">self-love</span>. That is what people do not understand – they even think that demands and jealousy and wounded vanity are signs of love or at least natural attendants of it.</p>
