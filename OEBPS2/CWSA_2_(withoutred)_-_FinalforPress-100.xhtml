			<p class="body-text">“Poetry, in fact, being Art, must attempt to make us see, and since it is to the inner senses that it has to address itself, – for the ear is its only physical gate of entry and even there its real appeal is to an inner hearing, – and since its object is to make us live within ourselves what the poet has embodied in his verse, it is an inner sight which he opens in us, and this inner sight must have been intense in him before he can awaken it in us.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Therefore the <a id="_idIndexMarker387"></a>greatest poets have been always those who have had a large and powerful interpretative and intuitive vision of Nature and life and man and whose poetry has arisen out of that in a supreme revelatory utterance of it. Homer, Shakespeare, Dante, Valmiki, Kalidasa, however much they may differ in everything else, are at one in having this as the fundamental character of their greatness. Their supremacy does not lie essentially in a greater thought-power or a more lavish imagery or a more penetrating force of passion and emotion; these things they may have had, one being more gifted in one direction, another in others, but these other powers were aids to their poetic expression rather than its essence or its source.” (<span class="ref-numbers- _idGenCharOverride-1">31</span>-<span class="ref-numbers- _idGenCharOverride-1">32</span>)</p>

			<p class="body-text">“The <a id="_idIndexMarker388"></a><span class="Index">poet-seer</span> sees differently, thinks in another way, voices himself in quite another manner than the philosopher or the prophet. The prophet announces the Truth as the Word, the Law or the command of the Eternal, he is the giver of the message; the poet shows us Truth in its power of beauty, in its symbol or image, or reveals it to us in the workings of Nature or in the workings of life, and when he has done that, his whole work is done; he need not be its explicit spokesman or its official messenger. The <a id="_idIndexMarker389"></a>philosopher’s business is to discriminate Truth and put its parts and aspects into intellectual relation with each other; the poet’s is to seize and embody aspects of Truth in their living relations, or rather – for that is too philosophical a language – to see her features and, excited by the vision, create in the beauty of her image.” (<span class="ref-numbers- _idGenCharOverride-1">33</span>-<span class="ref-numbers- _idGenCharOverride-1">34</span>)</p>
			<p class="star-single-center">***</p>
			<p class="body-text">“The <a id="_idIndexMarker390"></a><span class="Index">poetic vision</span> of things is not a criticism of life, not an intellectual or philosophic view of it, but a soul-view, a seizing by the inner sense. The <a id="_idIndexMarker391"></a><span class="Index">Mantra</span> too is not in its substance or its form a poetic enunciation of philosophic verities, but a rhythmic revelation or intuition arising out of the soul’s sight of God and Nature and itself and of the world and of the inner truth – occult to the outward eye – of all that peoples it, the secrets of their life and being.” (<span class="ref-numbers- _idGenCharOverride-1">36</span>)</p>
			<p class="star-single-center">***</p>
			<p class="body-text">“The poet really creates out of himself and not out of what he sees outwardly: that outward seeing only serves to excite the inner vision to its work. Otherwise his work would be a mechanical construction and putting together, not a living creation.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Sheer objectivity brings us down from art to photography; and the attempt to diminish the subjective view to the vanishing point so as to get an accurate presentation is proper to science, not to poetry. We are not thereby likely to get a greater truth or reality, but very much the reverse; for the scientific presentation of things, however valid in its own domain, that of the senses and the observing reason, is not true to the soul. It is not the integral truth or the whole vision of things, for it gives only their process and machinery and mechanic law, but not their inner life and spirit.” (<span class="ref-numbers- _idGenCharOverride-1">36</span>-<span class="ref-numbers- _idGenCharOverride-1">37</span>)</p>
