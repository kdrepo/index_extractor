			<p class="body-text">“The Vedantic position was that the Mind itself (as well as the senses) is a limited power making its own representations, constructions, formations and imposing them on the Reality. That is a much bigger and more intricate affair shooting down into the very roots of our existence. I think myself there are many positions taken by modern Science which tend to be helpful to that view – though in the nature of things they cannot be sufficient to prove it.” (<span class="ref-numbers- _idGenCharOverride-1">398</span>)</p>
