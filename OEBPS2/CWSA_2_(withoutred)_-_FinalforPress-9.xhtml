			<h2 id="_idParaDest-9" class="SubHead1">The Necessity of the Wholesale Conversion and the Difficulty in Doing It</h2>
			<p class="body-text">“And since <a id="_idIndexMarker034"></a><span class="Index">Yoga</span> is in its essence a turning away from the ordinary material and animal life led by most men or from the more mental but still limited way of living followed by the few to a greater spiritual life, to the way divine, every part of our energies that is given to the lower existence in the spirit of that existence is a contradiction of our aim and our self-dedication. On the other hand, every energy or activity that we can convert from its allegiance to the lower and dedicate to the service of the higher is so much gained on our road, so much taken from the powers that oppose our progress. It is the difficulty of this wholesale conversion that is the source of all the stumblings in the path of Yoga. For our entire nature and its environment, all our personal and all our universal self, are full of habits and of influences that are opposed to our spiritual rebirth and work against the whole-heartedness of our endeavour. In a certain sense we are nothing but a complex mass of mental, nervous and physical habits held together by a few ruling ideas, desires and associations, – an amalgam of many small self-repeating forces with a few major vibrations. What we propose in <a id="_idIndexMarker035"></a>our Yoga is nothing less than to break up the whole formation of our past and present which makes up the ordinary material and mental man and to create a new centre of vision and a new universe of activities in ourselves which shall constitute a divine humanity or a superhuman nature.” (<span class="ref-numbers- _idGenCharOverride-1">71</span>-<span class="ref-numbers- _idGenCharOverride-1">72</span>)</p>
