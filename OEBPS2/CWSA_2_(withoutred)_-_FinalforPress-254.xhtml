			<p class="body-text">“To concentrate most on one’s own spiritual growth and experience is the first necessity of the sadhak – to be too eager to help others draws away from the inner work. There is also likely to be an overzeal and haste which clouds the discrimination and makes what help is given less effective than it should be. To grow in the spirit is the greatest help one can give to others, for then something flows out naturally to those around that helps them.” (<span class="ref-numbers- _idGenCharOverride-1">317</span>)</p>

			<p class="body-text">“To want unwaveringly the welfare of another both in the head and the heart, is the best help one can give.” (<span class="ref-numbers- _idGenCharOverride-1">320</span>)</p>
