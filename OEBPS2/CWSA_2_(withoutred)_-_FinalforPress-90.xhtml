			<p class="body-text">“The <a id="_idIndexMarker356"></a><span class="Index">World-State</span> must now either be brought about by a mutual understanding or by the force of circumstances and a series of new and disastrous shocks. For the old still-prevailing order of things was founded on circumstances and conditions which no longer exist. A new order is demanded by the new conditions and, so long as it is not created, there will be a transitional era of continued trouble or recurrent disorders, inevitable crises through which Nature will effect in her own violent way the working out of the necessity which she has evolved.” (<span class="ref-numbers- _idGenCharOverride-1">463</span>)</p>
