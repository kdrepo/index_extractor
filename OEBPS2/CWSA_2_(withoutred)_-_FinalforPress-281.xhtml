			<p class="questions">“What is the utility of making an effort for other realisations once we have known the supreme secret (uttamaṁ rahasyam) that you are the Divine Incarnate and the Mother is the Para-Shakti? That is the highest realisation, I think, and all others – the realisation of the cosmic consciousness, of the presence of the immanent Divine, even of the silent immutable Brahman – are secondary in comparison with it. Whatever is to be done in the world will be done by you and the Mother.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Yes, but for that to be a constant realisation in its fullness the same effort has to be made and if made will bring the other realisations with it as parts of the main realisation. <span class="ref-numbers- _idGenCharOverride-1">30</span> October <span class="ref-numbers- _idGenCharOverride-1">1936</span>” (<span class="ref-numbers- _idGenCharOverride-1">86</span>)</p>
