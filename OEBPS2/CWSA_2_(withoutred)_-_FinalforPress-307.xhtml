			<p class="savitri-text">“One who has shaped this world is ever its lord:<br />Our errors are his steps upon the way;<br />He works through the fierce vicissitudes of our lives,<br />He works through the hard breath of battle and toil,<br />He works through our sins and sorrows and our tears,<br />His knowledge overrules our nescience;<br />Whatever the appearance we must bear,<br />Whatever our strong ills and present fate,<br />When nothing we can see but drift and bale,<br />A mighty Guidance leads us still through all.<br />After we have served this great divided world<br />God’s bliss and oneness are our inborn right.<br />A date is fixed in the calendar of the Unknown,<br />An anniversary of the Birth sublime:<br />Our soul shall justify its chequered walk,<br />All will come near that now is naught or far.” (<span class="ref-numbers- _idGenCharOverride-1">59</span>)</p>
