			<p class="savitri-text">“All moods unlovely, evil and untrue<br />Forsake their stations in fierce disarray<br />And hide their shame in the subconscient’s dusk.<br />Then lifts the mind a cry of victory:<br />“O soul, my soul, we have created Heaven,<br />Within we have found the kingdom here of God,<br />His fortress built in a loud ignorant world.<br />Our life is entrenched between two rivers of Light,<br />We have turned space into a gulf of peace<br />And made the body a Capitol of bliss.<br />What more, what more, if more must still be done?”<br />In the slow process of the evolving spirit,<br />In the brief stade between a death and birth<br />A first perfection’s stage is reached at last;<br />Out of the wood and stone of our nature’s stuff<br />A temple is shaped where the high gods could live.<br />Even if the struggling world is left outside<br />One man’s perfection still can save the world.<br />There is won a new proximity to the skies,<br />A first betrothal of the Earth to Heaven,<br />A deep concordat between Truth and Life:<br />A camp of God is pitched in human time.” (<span class="ref-numbers- _idGenCharOverride-1">531</span>)</p>
