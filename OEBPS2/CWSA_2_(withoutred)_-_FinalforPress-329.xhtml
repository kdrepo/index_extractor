			<p class="savitri-text">“In the texture of our bound humanity<br />He felt the stark resistance huge and dumb<br />Of our inconscient and unseeing base,<br />The stubborn mute rejection in life’s depths,<br />The ignorant No in the origin of things.<br />A veiled collaboration with the Night<br />Even in himself survived and hid from his view:<br />Still something in his earthly being kept<br />Its kinship with the Inconscient whence it came.<br />A shadowy unity with a vanished past<br />Treasured in an old-world frame was lurking there,<br />Secret, unnoted by the illumined mind,<br />And in subconscious whispers and in dream<br />Still murmured at the mind’s and spirit’s choice.<br />Its treacherous elements spread like slippery grains<br />Hoping the incoming Truth might stumble and fall,<br />And old ideal voices wandering moaned<br />And pleaded for a heavenly leniency<br />To the gracious imperfections of our earth<br />And the sweet weaknesses of our mortal state.<br />This now he willed to discover and exile,<br />The element in him betraying God.” (<span class="ref-numbers- _idGenCharOverride-1">317</span>-<span class="ref-numbers- _idGenCharOverride-1">18</span>)</p>
