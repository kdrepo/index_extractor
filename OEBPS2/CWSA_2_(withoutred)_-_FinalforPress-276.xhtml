			<p class="questions">“There are many who hold the view that she was human but now embodies the Divine Mother and her Prayers, they say, explain this view. But to my mental conception, to my psychic feeling, she is the Divine Mother who has consented to put on herself the cloak of obscurity and suffering and ignorance so that she can effectively lead us – human beings – to Knowledge and Bliss and Ananda and to Him.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The Divine puts on an appearance of humanity, assumes the outward human nature in order to tread the path and show it to human beings, but does not cease to be the Divine. It is a manifestation that takes place, a manifestation of a growing divine consciousness, not human turning into divine. The Mother was inwardly above the human even in childhood, so the view held by “many” is erroneous.” (<span class="ref-numbers- _idGenCharOverride-1">31</span>-<span class="ref-numbers- _idGenCharOverride-1">32</span>)</p>
