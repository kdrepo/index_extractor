			<p class="body-text">“The <a id="_idIndexMarker539"></a><a id="_idIndexMarker540"></a>bindu of which you speak is not the psychic being, but the soul or spark of the Divine which supports each existence; the psychic being is usually seen in form as a <a id="_idIndexMarker541"></a>Purusha. The psychic being is the soul or spark of the Divine developing a form of itself in the evolution which travels from life to life. The Jivatma and the soul are the same, but in two different statuses. The Jivatma is the Ansha of the Divine standing above the consciousness as the individual self and unchanged by the evolution – the soul is the same descended into the evolution and developing its consciousness from life to life until in the opening of knowledge the psychic being realises its oneness with the self above.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The <a id="_idIndexMarker542"></a>ego is quite different – it is a creation of Prakriti and part of Prakriti, which centralises the thoughts, desires, passions etc. of the nature and is involved in them entirely. The ego is not a real and eternal existence, but only a formation of Nature. It has to disappear by the coming of knowledge and be replaced by the true psychic and spiritual self.” (<span class="ref-numbers- _idGenCharOverride-1">107</span>)</p>
