			<p class="body-text">“Nirod, Nolini and Sahana are all wrong in laying down a rule of that kind for my conduct. I do not base my action on mental rules which have to be applied to every case. It is a still greater error to suppose that because I (or the Mother) do something in the case of one person or another, we are bound to do it for everybody and to complain of our not doing it as “making a difference”. All that belongs to the ignorance and clamour of the vital egoistic nature and has nothing to do with spiritual life. ... The spiritual life and one’s own inner psychic and spiritual change should be the first preoccupation of a sadhak – poetry or painting is something quite subordinate and even then it should be done not to be a great poet or artist but as a help to the inner sadhana. It is time that everyone got away from the vital view of things to the psychic and spiritual on which alone can stand Yoga and the spiritual life.” (<span class="ref-numbers- _idGenCharOverride-1">724</span>-<span class="ref-numbers- _idGenCharOverride-1">25</span>)</p>
