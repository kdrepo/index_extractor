			<p class="body-text">“Dance alone with rhythm and significance can express something of the occult or of the Divine as much as writing or poetry or art – why should it not and why should there be anything in it condemnable?” <span class="ref-numbers- _idGenCharOverride-1">17</span> July <span class="ref-numbers- _idGenCharOverride-1">1933</span> (<span class="ref-numbers- _idGenCharOverride-1">739</span>)</p>

			<p class="body-text">To feel the vibration and develop from it the rhythm of the dance is the right way to create something true; the other way, to understand with the mind and work out with the mind only or mainly, is the mental way; it is laborious and difficult and has not the same spontaneous inspiration.” <span class="ref-numbers- _idGenCharOverride-1">28</span> April <span class="ref-numbers- _idGenCharOverride-1">1932</span> (<span class="ref-numbers- _idGenCharOverride-1">739</span>)</p>
