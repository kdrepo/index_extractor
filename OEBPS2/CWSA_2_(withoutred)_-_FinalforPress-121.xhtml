			<p class="body-text">“When I said there were no greater poets than Homer and Shakespeare, I was thinking of their essential poetic force and beauty – not of the scope of their work as a whole, for there are poets greater in their range. The <a id="_idIndexMarker444"></a><span class="Index">Mahabharata</span> is from that point of view a far greater creation than the <a id="_idIndexMarker445"></a><span class="Index">Iliad</span>, the <a id="_idIndexMarker446"></a><span class="Index">Ramayana</span> than the <a id="_idIndexMarker447"></a><span class="Index">Odyssey</span>, and either spreads its strength and its achievement over a larger field than the whole dramatic world of Shakespeare; both are built on an almost cosmic vastness of plan and take all human life (the Mahabharata all human thought as well) in their scope and touch too on things which the Greek and Elizabethan poets could not even glimpse. But as poets – as masters of rhythm and language and the expression of poetic beauty – Vyasa and Valmiki are not inferior, but also not greater than the English or the Greek poet.” (<span class="ref-numbers- _idGenCharOverride-1">367</span>-<span class="ref-numbers- _idGenCharOverride-1">68</span>)</p>
