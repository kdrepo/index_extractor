			<p class="savitri-text">“Who art thou who claimst thy crown of separate birth,<br />The illusion of thy soul’s reality<br />And personal godhead on an ignorant globe<br />In the animal body of imperfect man?<br />Hope not to be happy in a world of pain<br />And dream not, listening to the unspoken Word<br />And dazzled by the inexpressible Ray,<br />Transcending the mute Superconscient’s realm,<br />To give a body to the Unknowable,<br />Or for a sanction to thy heart’s delight<br />To burden with bliss the silent still Supreme<br />Profaning its bare and formless sanctity,<br />Or call into thy chamber the Divine<br />And sit with God tasting a human joy.<br />I have created all, all I devour;<br />I am Death and the dark terrible Mother of life,<br />I am Kali black and naked in the world,<br />I am Maya and the universe is my cheat.<br />I lay waste human happiness with my breath<br />And slay the will to live, the joy to be<br />That all may pass back into nothingness<br />And only abide the eternal and absolute.<br />For only the blank Eternal can be true.<br />All else is shadow and flash in Mind’s bright glass,<br />Mind, hollow mirror in which Ignorance sees<br />A splendid figure of its own false self<br />And dreams it sees a glorious solid world.<br />O soul, inventor of man’s thoughts and hopes,<br />Thyself the invention of the moments’ stream,<br />Illusion’s centre or subtle apex point,<br />At last know thyself, from vain existence cease.”<br />A shadow of the negating Absolute,<br />The intolerant Darkness travelled surging past<br />And ebbed in her the formidable Voice.<br />It left behind her inner world laid waste:<br />A barren silence weighed upon her heart,<br />Her kingdom of delight was there no more;<br />Only her soul remained, its emptied stage,<br />Awaiting the unknown eternal Will.” (<span class="ref-numbers- _idGenCharOverride-1">534</span>-<span class="ref-numbers- _idGenCharOverride-1">36</span>)</p>
