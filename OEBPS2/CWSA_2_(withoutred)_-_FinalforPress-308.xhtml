			<p class="savitri-text">“In a thousand ways he serves her royal needs;<br />He makes the hours pivot around her will,<br />Makes all reflect her whims; all is their play:<br />This whole wide world is only he and she.</p>
			<p class="savitri-text">This is the knot that ties together the stars:<br />The Two who are one are the secret of all power,<br />The Two who are one are the might and right in things.<br />His soul, silent, supports the world and her,<br />His acts are her commandment’s registers.<br />Happy, inert, he lies beneath her feet:<br />His breast he offers for her cosmic dance<br />Of which our lives are the quivering theatre,<br />And none could bear but for his strength within,<br />Yet none would leave because of his delight.” (<span class="ref-numbers- _idGenCharOverride-1">63</span>)</p>
