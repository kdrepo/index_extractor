			<p class="savitri-text">“The truth thou hast claimed; I give to thee the truth.<br />A marvel of the meeting earth and heavens<br />Is he whom Savitri has chosen mid men,<br />His figure is the front of Nature’s march,<br />His single being excels the works of Time.<br />A sapphire cutting from the sleep of heaven,<br />Delightful is the soul of Satyavan,<br />...........<br />His sweetness and his joy attract all hearts<br />To live with his own in a glad tenancy,<br />His strength is like a tower built to reach heaven,<br />A godhead quarried from the stones of life.<br />O loss, if death into its elements<br />Of which his gracious envelope was built,<br />Shatter this vase before it breathes its sweets,<br />As if earth could not keep too long from heaven<br />A treasure thus unique loaned by the gods,<br />A being so rare, of so divine a make!<br />In one brief year when this bright hour flies back<br />And perches careless on a branch of Time,<br />This sovereign glory ends heaven lent to earth,<br />This splendour vanishes from the mortal’s sky:<br />Heaven’s greatness came, but was too great to stay.<br />Twelve swift-winged months are given to him and her;<br />This day returning Satyavan must die.” (<span class="ref-numbers- _idGenCharOverride-1">429</span>-<span class="ref-numbers- _idGenCharOverride-1">31</span>)</p>
