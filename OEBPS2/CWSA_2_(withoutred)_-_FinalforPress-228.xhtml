			<p class="body-text">“Merely to have experiences of the higher consciousness will not change the nature. Either the higher consciousness has to make a dynamic descent into the whole being and change it – or it must establish itself in the inner being down to the inner physical so that the latter feels itself separate from the outer and is able to act freely upon it – or the psychic must come forward and change the nature – or the inner will must awake and force the nature to change. These are the four ways in which change can be brought about.” (<span class="ref-numbers- _idGenCharOverride-1">23</span>)</p>
