			<p class="body-text">““Patala” ... is a name for the subconscient – the beings there had no heads, that is to say, there is there no mental consciousness; men have all of them such a subconscient plane in their own being and from there rise all sorts of irrational and ignorant (headless) instincts, impulsions, memories etc. which have an effect upon their acts and feelings without their detecting the real source. At night many incoherent dreams come from this world or plane. The world above is the superconscient plane of being – above the human consciousness – there are many worlds of that kind; they are divine worlds.” (<span class="ref-numbers- _idGenCharOverride-1">222</span>)</p>
