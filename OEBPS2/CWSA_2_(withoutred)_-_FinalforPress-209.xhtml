			<h2 id="_idParaDest-209" class="SubHead1"><a id="_idIndexMarker739"></a><span class="Index">Faith</span></h2>
			<p class="body-text">“Faith in the spiritual sense is not a mental <a id="_idIndexMarker740"></a><span class="Index">belief</span> which can waver and change. It can wear that form in the mind, but that belief is not the faith itself, it is only its external form. Just as the body, the external form, can change but the spirit remains the same, so it is here. Faith is a certitude in the soul which does not depend on reasoning, on this or that mental idea, on circumstances, on this or that passing condition of the mind or the vital or the body. It may be hidden, eclipsed, may even seem to be quenched, but it reappears again after the storm or the eclipse; it is seen burning still in the soul when one has thought that it was extinguished for ever. The mind may be a shifting sea of doubts and yet that faith may be there within and, if so, it will keep even the doubt-racked mind in the way so that it goes on in spite of itself towards its destined goal. Faith is a <a id="_idIndexMarker741"></a>spiritual certitude of the spiritual, the divine, the soul’s ideal, something that clings to that even when it is not fulfilled in life, even when the immediate facts or the persistent circumstances seem to deny it. This is a common experience in the life of the human being; if it were not so, man would be the plaything of a changing mind or a sport of circumstance.” (<span class="ref-numbers- _idGenCharOverride-1">89</span>-<span class="ref-numbers- _idGenCharOverride-1">90</span>)</p>
