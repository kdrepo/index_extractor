			<h2 id="_idParaDest-27" class="SubHead1">The Truest Reason for <a id="_idIndexMarker087"></a>Seeking Liberation</h2>
			<p class="body-text">“The truest reason why we must seek <a id="_idIndexMarker088"></a><span class="Index">liberation</span> is not to be delivered, individually, from the sorrow of the world, though that deliverance too will be given to us, but that we may be one with the Divine, the Supreme, the Eternal. The truest reason why we must seek perfection, a supreme status, purity, knowledge, strength, love, capacity, is not that personally we may enjoy the divine Nature or be even as the gods, though that enjoyment too will be ours, but because this liberation and perfection are the divine Will in us, the highest truth of our self in Nature, the always intended goal of a progressive manifestation in the universe. The divine Nature, free and perfect and blissful, must be manifested in the individual in order that it may manifest in the world. Even in the Ignorance the individual lives really in the universal and for the universal Purpose, for in the very act of pursuing the purposes and desires of his ego, he is forced by Nature to contribute by his egoistic action to her work and purpose in the worlds; but it is without conscious intention, imperfectly done, and his contribution is to her half-evolved and half-conscient, her imperfect and crude movement. To escape from ego and be united with the Divine is at once the liberation and the consummation of his individuality; so liberated, purified, perfected, the individual – the divine soul – lives consciously and entirely, as was from the first intended, in and for the cosmic and transcendent Divine and for his Will in the universe.” (<span class="ref-numbers- _idGenCharOverride-1">275</span>)</p>
