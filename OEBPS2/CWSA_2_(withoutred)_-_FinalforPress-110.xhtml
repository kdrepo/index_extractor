			<p class="body-text">“...take Shelley’s stanza – </p>
			<p class="body-text-poetry">&#9;We look before and after,<br />&#9;&#9;And pine for what is not:<br />&#9;Our sincerest laughter<br />&#9;&#9;With some pain is fraught;<br />Our sweetest songs are those that tell of saddest thought.</p>
			<p class="body-text">This is perfect poetry with the most exquisite melody and beauty of wording and an unsurpassable poignancy of pathos, but there is no touch or note of the overhead inspiration: it is the mind and the heart, the vital emotion, working at their highest pitch under the stress of a psychic inspiration. The rhythm is of the same character, a direct, straightforward, lucid and lucent movement welling out limpidly straight from the psychic source. The same characteristics are found in another short lyric of Shelley’s which is perhaps the purest example of the psychic inspiration in English poetry:</p>
			<p class="body-text-poetry">I can give not what men call love,<br />&#9;But wilt thou accept not<br />The worship the heart lifts above<br />&#9;And the Heavens reject not, – <br />The desire of the moth for the star,<br />&#9;Of the night for the morrow,<br />The devotion to something afar<br />&#9;From the sphere of our sorrow?</p>
			<p class="body-text">We have again extreme poetic beauty there, but nothing of the overhead note.” (<span class="ref-numbers- _idGenCharOverride-1">35</span>-<span class="ref-numbers- _idGenCharOverride-1">36</span>)</p>
