			<h2 id="_idParaDest-173" class="SubHead1">The Emotional Being of <a id="_idIndexMarker632"></a>Animals Much More Psychic than that of Man</h2>
			<p class="body-text">“The emotional being of animals is often much more psychic than that of men who can be very insensitive. There were recently pictures of the tame tigress kept by a family and afterwards given by them to a Zoo. The look of sorrow on the face of the tigress in her cage at once gentle and tragically poignant is so intense as to be heartbreaking.” (<span class="ref-numbers- _idGenCharOverride-1">406</span>)</p>
