			<p class="savitri-text">“Whoever is too great must lonely live.<br />Adored he walks in mighty solitude;<br />Vain is his labour to create his kind,<br />His only comrade is the Strength within.<br />Thus was it for a while with Savitri.<br />All worshipped marvellingly, none dared to claim.<br />Her mind sat high pouring its golden beams,<br />Her heart was a crowded temple of delight.<br />A single lamp lit in perfection’s house,<br />A bright pure image in a priestless shrine,<br />Midst those encircling lives her spirit dwelt,<br />Apart in herself until her hour of fate.” (<span class="ref-numbers- _idGenCharOverride-1">368</span>)</p>
