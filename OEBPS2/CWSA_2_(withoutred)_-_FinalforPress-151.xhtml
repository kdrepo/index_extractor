			<p class="body-text">“If we regard Vaikuntha or Goloka each as the world of a Divinity, Vishnu or Krishna, we would be naturally led to seek its place or its origin in the Overmind plane. The Overmind is the plane of the highest worlds of the Gods. But Vaikuntha and Goloka are human conceptions of states of being that are beyond humanity.

It is not necessary to assign any single plane to this manifestation – in fact there can be a reflection or possession of it or of its conditions on any plane of consciousness – the mental, vital or even the subtle physical plane.” (<span class="ref-numbers- _idGenCharOverride-1">140</span>)</p>
