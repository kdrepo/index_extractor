			<p class="body-text">“<a id="_idIndexMarker515"></a><span class="Index">Higher Mind</span> is one of the planes of the <a id="_idIndexMarker516"></a><span class="Index">spiritual mind</span>, the first and lowest of them; it is above the normal mental level. Inner mind is that which lies behind the surface mind (our ordinary mentality) and can only be directly experienced (apart from its vrittis in the surface mind such as philosophy, poetry, idealism etc.) by sadhana, by breaking down the habit of being on the surface and by going deeper within.</p>
			<p class="body-text"><a id="_idIndexMarker517"></a>Larger mind is a general term to cover the realms of mind which become our field whether by going within or widening into the cosmic consciousness.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The true <a id="_idIndexMarker518"></a>mental being is not the same as the inner mental – true mental, true vital, true physical being means the Purusha of that level freed from the error and ignorant thought and will of the lower Prakriti and directly open to the knowledge and guidance from above.</p>
			<p class="body-text"><a id="_idIndexMarker519"></a><span class="Index">Higher vital</span> usually refers to the vital mind and emotive being as opposed to the middle vital which has its seat in the navel and is dynamic, sensational and passionate and the lower which is made up of the smaller movements of human life-desire and life-reactions.” (<span class="ref-numbers- _idGenCharOverride-1">85</span>-<span class="ref-numbers- _idGenCharOverride-1">86</span>)</p>
