			<p class="savitri-text">“In a divine retreat from mortal thought,<br />In a prodigious gesture of soul-sight,<br />His being towered into pathless heights,<br />Naked of its vesture of humanity.<br />As thus it rose, to meet him bare and pure<br />A strong Descent leaped down. A Might, a Flame,<br />A Beauty half-visible with deathless eyes,<br />A violent Ecstasy, a Sweetness dire,<br />Enveloped him with its stupendous limbs<br />And penetrated nerve and heart and brain<br />That thrilled and fainted with the epiphany:<br />His nature shuddered in the Unknown’s grasp.<br />In a moment shorter than death, longer than Time,<br />By a Power more ruthless than Love, happier than Heaven,<br />Taken sovereignly into eternal arms,<br />Haled and coerced by a stark absolute bliss,<br />In a whirlwind circuit of delight and force<br />Hurried into unimaginable depths,<br />Upborne into immeasurable heights,<br />It was torn out from its mortality<br />And underwent a new and bourneless change.<br />An Omniscient knowing without sight or thought,<br />An indecipherable Omnipotence,<br />A mystic Form that could contain the worlds,<br />Yet make one human breast its passionate shrine,<br />Drew him out of his seeking loneliness<br />Into the magnitudes of God’s embrace.” (<span class="ref-numbers- _idGenCharOverride-1">80</span>-<span class="ref-numbers- _idGenCharOverride-1">81</span>)</p>
