			<p class="savitri-text">“If thou wouldst a little loosen the vast chain,<br />Draw back from the world that the Idea has made,<br />Thy mind’s selection from the Infinite,<br />Thy senses’ gloss on the Infinitesimal’s dance,<br />Then shalt thou know how the great bondage came.<br />Banish all thought from thee and be God’s void.<br />Then shalt thou uncover the Unknowable<br />And the Superconscient conscious grow on thy tops;<br />Infinity’s vision through thy gaze shall pierce;<br />Thou shalt look into the eyes of the Unknown,<br />Find the hid Truth in things seen null and false,<br />Behind things known discover Mystery’s rear.<br />Thou shalt be one with God’s bare reality<br />And the miraculous world he has become<br />And the diviner miracle still to be<br />When Nature who is now unconscious God<br />Translucent grows to the Eternal’s light,<br />Her seeing his sight, her walk his steps of power<br />And life is filled with a spiritual joy<br />And Matter is the Spirit’s willing bride.<br />Consent to be nothing and none, dissolve Time’s work,<br />Cast off thy mind, step back from form and name.<br />Annul thyself that only God may be.” (<span class="ref-numbers- _idGenCharOverride-1">537</span>-<span class="ref-numbers- _idGenCharOverride-1">38</span>)</p>
