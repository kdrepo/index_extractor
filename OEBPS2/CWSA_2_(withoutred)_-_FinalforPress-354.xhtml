			<p class="savitri-text">“But since she knows the toil of mind and life<br />As a mother feels and shares her children’s lives,<br />She puts forth a small portion of herself,<br />A being no bigger than the thumb of man<br />Into a hidden region of the heart<br />To face the pang and to forget the bliss,<br />To share the suffering and endure earth’s wounds<br />And labour mid the labour of the stars.<br />This in us laughs and weeps, suffers the stroke,<br />Exults in victory, struggles for the crown;<br />Identified with the mind and body and life,<br />It takes on itself their anguish and defeat,<br />Bleeds with Fate’s whips and hangs upon the cross,<br />Yet is the unwounded and immortal self<br />Supporting the actor in the human scene.<br />Through this she sends us her glory and her powers,<br />Pushes to wisdom’s heights, through misery’s gulfs;<br />She gives us strength to do our daily task<br />And sympathy that partakes of others’ grief<br />And the little strength we have to help our race,<br />We who must fill the role of the universe<br />Acting itself out in a slight human shape</p>
			<p class="savitri-text">And on our shoulders carry the struggling world.<br />This is in us the godhead small and marred;<br />In this human portion of divinity<br />She seats the greatness of the Soul in Time<br />To uplift from light to light, from power to power,<br />Till on a heavenly peak it stands, a king.<br />In body weak, in its heart an invincible might,<br />It climbs stumbling, held up by an unseen hand,<br />A toiling spirit in a mortal shape.<br />Here in this chamber of flame and light they met;<br />They looked upon each other, knew themselves,<br />The secret deity and its human part,<br />The calm immortal and the struggling soul.<br />Then with a magic transformation’s speed<br />They rushed into each other and grew one.” (<span class="ref-numbers- _idGenCharOverride-1">526</span>-<span class="ref-numbers- _idGenCharOverride-1">27</span>)</p>
