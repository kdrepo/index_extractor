			<p class="savitri-text">“A MIGHTIER task remained than all he had done.<br />To That he turned from which all being comes,<br />A sign attending from the Secrecy<br />Which knows the Truth ungrasped behind our thoughts<br />And guards the world with its all-seeing gaze.<br />In the unapproachable stillness of his soul,<br />Intense, one-pointed, monumental, lone,<br />Patient he sat like an incarnate hope<br />Motionless on a pedestal of prayer.<br />A strength he sought that was not yet on earth,<br />Help from a Power too great for mortal will,<br />The light of a Truth now only seen afar,<br />A sanction from his high omnipotent Source.<br />But from the appalling heights there stooped no voice;<br />The timeless lids were closed; no opening came.<br />A neutral helpless void oppressed the years.” (<span class="ref-numbers- _idGenCharOverride-1">317</span>)</p>
