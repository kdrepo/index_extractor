			<p class="savitri-text">“A being stood immortal in transience,<br />Deathless dallying with momentary things,<br />In whose wide eyes of tranquil happiness<br />Which pity and sorrow could not abrogate<br />Infinity turned its gaze on finite shapes:<br />Observer of the silent steps of the hours,<br />Eternity upheld the minute’s acts<br />And the passing scenes of the Everlasting’s play.<br />In the mystery of its selecting will,<br />In the Divine Comedy a participant,<br />The Spirit’s conscious representative,<br />God’s delegate in our humanity,<br />Comrade of the universe, the Transcendent’s ray,<br />She had come into the mortal body’s room<br />To play at ball with Time and Circumstance.<br />A joy in the world her master movement here,<br />The passion of the game lighted her eyes:<br />A smile on her lips welcomed earth’s bliss and grief,<br />A laugh was her return to pleasure and pain.<br />All things she saw as a masquerade of Truth<br />Disguised in the costumes of Ignorance,<br />Crossing the years to immortality;<br />All she could front with the strong spirit’s peace.” (<span class="ref-numbers- _idGenCharOverride-1">526</span>)</p>
