			<p class="body-text">“I do not know that any except a very few great Yogis have really changed their outer nature. In all the Asrams I have seen people were just as others except for certain specific moral controls put on certain kinds of outer action (food, sex etc.), but the general nature was the human nature (as in the story of Narad and Janaka). It is even a theory of the old Yogas that the prārabdha karma and therefore necessarily the permanent elements of external character do not change – only one gets the inner realisation and separates oneself from it so that it drops off at death like a soiled robe and leaves the spirit free to enter into Nirvana. <a id="_idIndexMarker770"></a>Our object is a <a id="_idIndexMarker771"></a><span class="Index">spiritual change</span> and not merely an ethical control, but this can only come first by a spiritual rejection from within and then by a supramental descent from above.” (<span class="ref-numbers- _idGenCharOverride-1">405</span>)</p>
