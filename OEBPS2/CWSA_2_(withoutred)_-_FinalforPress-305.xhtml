			<p class="savitri-text">“Thus will the masked Transcendent mount his throne.<br />When darkness deepens strangling the earth’s breast<br />And man’s corporeal mind is the only lamp,<br />As a thief’s in the night shall be the covert tread<br />Of one who steps unseen into his house.<br />A Voice ill-heard shall speak, the soul obey,<br />A Power into mind’s inner chamber steal,<br />A charm and sweetness open life’s closed doors<br />And beauty conquer the resisting world,<br />The Truth-Light capture Nature by surprise,<br />A stealth of God compel the heart to bliss<br />And earth grow unexpectedly divine.<br />In Matter shall be lit the spirit’s glow,<br />In body and body kindled the sacred birth;<br />Night shall awake to the anthem of the stars,<br />The days become a happy pilgrim march,<br />Our will a force of the Eternal’s power,<br />And thought the rays of a spiritual sun.<br />A few shall see what none yet understands;<br />God shall grow up while the wise men talk and sleep;<br />For man shall not know the coming till its hour<br />And belief shall be not till the work is done.” (<span class="ref-numbers- _idGenCharOverride-1">56</span>)</p>
