			<p class="body-text">“There is only one thing that can truly save you, it is to have a contact, even the slightest, with your psychic being – to have felt the solidity of that contact. Then whatever comes to you from this person or that circumstance you place in front of that and see whether it is all right or not. Even if you are satisfied – in every way – even if you say to yourself: “At last I have found the friend I wanted to have. I am in the best circumstances of my life, etc.”, then put that before this little <a id="_idIndexMarker286"></a>contact with your psychic being, you will see whether it keeps its bright colour or suddenly there comes a little uneasiness, not much, nothing making a great noise, but just a little uneasiness. You are no longer so sure that it was as you thought! Then you know: yes, it is that small voice which one must listen to always. It is that which is the truth and the other can’t trouble you any longer.” <span class="Character-Style-1 _idGenCharOverride-1">15</span> July <span class="Character-Style-1 _idGenCharOverride-1">1953</span> (<span class="Character-Style-1 _idGenCharOverride-1">156</span>-<span class="Character-Style-1 _idGenCharOverride-1">57</span>)</p>
