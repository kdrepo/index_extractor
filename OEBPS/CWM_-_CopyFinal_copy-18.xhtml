			<p class="body-text">“*THERE is a <a id="_idIndexMarker001"></a>sovereign royalty in taking no thought for oneself. To have needs is to assert a weakness; to claim something proves that we lack what we claim. To <a id="_idIndexMarker002"></a>desire is to be impotent; it is to recognise our limitations and confess our incapacity to overcome them.</p>
			<p class="body-text">If only from the point of view of a legitimate pride, man should be noble enough to renounce desire. How humiliating to ask something for oneself from life or from the Supreme Consciousness which animates it! How humiliating for us, how ignorant an offence against Her! For all is within our reach, only the egoistic limits of our being prevent us from enjoying the whole universe as completely and concretely as we possess our own body and its immediate surroundings.*” (<span class="Character-Style-1 _idGenCharOverride-1">359</span>)</p>
