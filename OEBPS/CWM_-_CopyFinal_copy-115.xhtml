			<p class="body-text">“What men generally do, with much effort and a good deal of suffering which gives them the impression that they are heroes, is to knock down their fortress... only to enter immediately into another! That does not make much difference from the standpoint of the Truth, but it gives them the impression of having made a great progress, because the old fortress is razed and they have built up another.</p>
			<p class="body-text">To live without a fortress is extremely difficult – people have the feeling that they are not living, that they are not individualised, that they are floating about. It is extremely difficult to live in something infinitely vast, moving, constantly changing, perpetually in progress, not to be held by anything to which one can cling, saying “I am this; this is my way of thinking.” It is very difficult, one must not try it too soon; there are those whose mind gets deranged by it.</p>
			<p class="question-Style">What is it that makes the <a id="_idIndexMarker197"></a>mental construction?</p>
			<p class="body-text">It is the mental ego which makes the construction and it clings to it desperately.” <span class="Character-Style-1 _idGenCharOverride-1">12</span> March <span class="Character-Style-1 _idGenCharOverride-1">1951</span> (<span class="Character-Style-1 _idGenCharOverride-1">200</span>)</p>
