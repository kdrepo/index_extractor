			<p class="body-text">“At the moment we are at a decisive <a id="_idIndexMarker509"></a>turning-point in the history of the earth, once again. From every side I am asked, “What is going to happen?” Everywhere there is anguish, expectation, fear. “What is going to happen?…” There is only one reply: “If only man could consent to be spiritualised.”</p>
			<p class="body-text">And perhaps it would be enough if some individuals became pure gold, for this would be enough to change the course of events…. We are faced with this necessity in a very urgent way.</p>
			<p class="body-text">This courage, this heroism which the Divine wants of us, why not use it to fight against one’s own difficulties, one’s own imperfections, one’s own obscurities? Why not heroically face the furnace of inner purification so that it does not become necessary to pass once more through one of those terrible, gigantic destructions which plunge an entire civilisation into darkness?</p>
			<p class="body-text">This is the problem before us. It is for each one to solve it in his own way.” <span class="Character-Style-1 _idGenCharOverride-1">27</span> March <span class="Character-Style-1 _idGenCharOverride-1">1957</span> (<span class="Character-Style-1 _idGenCharOverride-1">75</span>)</p>
