			<p class="body-text">“<a id="_idIndexMarker671"></a>Example is the most powerful instructor. Never demand from a child an effort of discipline that you do not make yourself. Calm, equanimity, order, method, absence of useless words, ought to be constantly practised by the teacher if he wants to instil them into his pupils.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The teacher should always be punctual and come to the class a few minutes before it begins, always properly dressed. And above all, so that his students should never lie, he must never lie himself; so that his students should never lose their tempers, he should never lose his temper with them; and to have the right to say to them, “Rough play often ends in tears”, he should never raise his hand against any of them.</p>
			<p class="body-text">These are elementary and preliminary things which ought to be practised in all schools without exception.” <span class="Character-Style-1 _idGenCharOverride-1">16</span> July <span class="Character-Style-1 _idGenCharOverride-1">1963</span> (<span class="Character-Style-1 _idGenCharOverride-1">193</span>)</p>
