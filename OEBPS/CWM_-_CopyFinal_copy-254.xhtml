			<p class="body-text">“There is always a moment when everyone has self-control. And if one had not said “Yes” once, if one had not taken the decision, one would not have done it.</p>
			<p class="body-text">There is not one human being who has not the energy and capacity to resist something imposed upon him – if he is left free to do so. People tell you, “I can’t do otherwise” – it is because in the depths of their heart they do not want to do otherwise; they have accepted to be the slaves of their vice. There is a moment when one accepts.</p>
			<p class="body-text">And I would go even further; I say, there is a moment when one accepts to be ill. If one did not accept to be ill, one would not be ill. Only, people are so unconscious of themselves and their inner movements that they are not even aware of what they do.” <span class="Character-Style-1 _idGenCharOverride-1">4</span> January <span class="Character-Style-1 _idGenCharOverride-1">1956</span> (<span class="Character-Style-1 _idGenCharOverride-1">5</span>) </p>
