			<p class="body-text">“Yes, for instance, if one wants to become somebody very important, to have a high position or attract the admiration of people around him, to become a great sadhak, a great sannyasi, a great yogi, etc., somebody quite important, that is called having a faith full of ambition. You have the faith that this may happen, you have faith in the Divine, but it is for your own small personal vainglory; and this is no longer something pure, sincere and true. It is something that’s entirely for personal profit. Naturally, there is no question in this of any self-giving; it is a hoarding of forces&#160;as much as it is possible for you to hoard them, that is to say, the very opposite of the true movement. This happens much oftener than one would think…. This movement of ambition is often hidden right in the depths of the being and it pushes you, like this, from behind… It whips you so that you get on. It is a kind of veiled pride.” <span class="Character-Style-1 _idGenCharOverride-1">21</span> July <span class="Character-Style-1 _idGenCharOverride-1">1954</span> (<span class="Character-Style-1 _idGenCharOverride-1">237</span>-<span class="Character-Style-1 _idGenCharOverride-1">38</span>)</p>
