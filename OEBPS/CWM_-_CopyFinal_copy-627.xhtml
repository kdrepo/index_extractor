			<p class="body-text">“The soul and the psychic being are not exactly the same thing, although their essence is the same.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The soul is the divine spark that dwells at the centre of each being; it is identical with its Divine Origin; it is the divine in man.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The psychic being is formed progressively around this divine centre, the soul, in the course of its innumerable lives in the terrestrial evolution, until the time comes when the psychic being, fully formed and wholly awakened, becomes the conscious sheath of the soul around which it is formed.</p>
			<p class="body-text">And thus identified with the Divine, it becomes His perfect instrument in the world.” <span class="Character-Style-1 _idGenCharOverride-1">16</span> July, <span class="Character-Style-1 _idGenCharOverride-1">1960</span> (<span class="Character-Style-1 _idGenCharOverride-1">245</span>-<span class="Character-Style-1 _idGenCharOverride-1">46</span>)</p>
