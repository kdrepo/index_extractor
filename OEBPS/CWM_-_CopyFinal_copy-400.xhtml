			<p class="body-text">“What you should do is to teach the children to take interest in what they are doing – that is not the same thing as interesting the students! You must arouse in them the desire for knowledge, for progress. One can take an interest in anything – in sweeping a room, for example – if one does it with concentration, in order to gain an experience, to make a progress, to become more conscious. I often say this to the students who complain of having a bad teacher. Even if they don’t like the teacher, even if he tells them useless things or if he is not up to the mark, they can always derive some benefit from their period of class, learn something of great interest and progress in consciousness.” <br /><span class="Character-Style-1 _idGenCharOverride-1">16</span> December <span class="Character-Style-1 _idGenCharOverride-1">1959</span> (<span class="Character-Style-1 _idGenCharOverride-1">170</span>)</p>
