			<p class="body-text">“He had gathered in his body a great amount of supramental force and as soon as he left... You see, he was lying on his bed, I stood by his side, and in a way altogether concrete – concrete with such a strong sensation as to make one think that it could be seen – all this supramental force which was in him passed from his body into mine. And I felt the friction of the passage. It was extraordinary – extraordinary. It was an extraordinary experience. For a long time, a long time like that (Mother indicates the passing of the Force into her body). I was standing beside his bed, and that continued. </p>
			<p class="body-text">Almost a sensation – it was a material sensation. </p>
			<p class="body-text">For a long time. </p>
