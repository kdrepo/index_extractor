			<p class="body-text">“Three typical modes of total <a id="_idIndexMarker717"></a>self-giving to the Divine:</p>
			<p class="body-text">(<span class="Character-Style-1 _idGenCharOverride-1">1</span>) To prostrate oneself at His feet, giving up all pride in perfect humility.</p>
			<p class="body-text">(<span class="Character-Style-1 _idGenCharOverride-1">2</span>) To unfold one’s being before Him, open one’s whole body from head to foot, as one opens a book, exposing one’s centres so as to make all their movements visible in a complete sincerity that allows nothing to remain hidden.</p>
			<p class="body-text">(<span class="Character-Style-1 _idGenCharOverride-1">3</span>) To nestle in His arms, to merge in Him in a loving and absolute trust.</p>
			<p class="body-text">These movements may be accompanied by three formulas or any one of them according to the case:</p>
			<p class="body-text">(<span class="Character-Style-1 _idGenCharOverride-1">1</span>) Let Thy Will be done and not mine.</p>
			<p class="body-text">(<span class="Character-Style-1 _idGenCharOverride-1">2</span>) As Thou willest, as Thou willest.</p>
			<p class="body-text">(<span class="Character-Style-1 _idGenCharOverride-1">3</span>) I am Thine for eternity.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Generally, when these movements are done in the true way, they are followed by a perfect identification, a dissolution of the ego, giving rise to a sublime felicity.” <span class="Character-Style-1 _idGenCharOverride-1">21</span> March <span class="Character-Style-1 _idGenCharOverride-1">1965</span> (<span class="Character-Style-1 _idGenCharOverride-1">102</span>-<span class="Character-Style-1 _idGenCharOverride-1">03</span>)</p>
