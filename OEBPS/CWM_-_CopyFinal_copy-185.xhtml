			<p class="body-text">“When you receive an order, you may carry it out with resignation because you&#160;have resolved to submit; so you carry out this order without any joy or pleasure, just very drily and superficially, and you tell yourself, “I was told to do this and I am doing it.” This means that you do not try to understand and make no effort to adhere willingly to what is asked. This is resigned submission. You accept your fate and if you do not complain it is because you have determined not to complain, it is because of this determination, otherwise you would complain.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The other instance is of understanding why an order was given, of grasping its inner value and wanting to express what has been asked with all one’s strength, with the knowledge and joy that it is something, perforce, that’s bound to bring the Divine closer and give you full satisfaction. Then you are happy, you are satisfied and you collaborate. That makes quite a considerable difference.” <span class="Character-Style-1 _idGenCharOverride-1">17</span> March <span class="Character-Style-1 _idGenCharOverride-1">1954</span> (<span class="Character-Style-1 _idGenCharOverride-1">63</span>-<span class="Character-Style-1 _idGenCharOverride-1">64</span>)</p>
