			<p class="body-text">“The need for <a id="_idIndexMarker722"></a>human love, to the extent that it is not merely in obedience to the instinct of Nature or to a vital attraction, is the need to have a Divine for oneself alone, at one’s entire and exclusive disposal, a Divine who is one’s personal property and to whom one gives oneself totally only if the gift is reciprocated.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Instead of enlarging oneself to the size of the Divine and having a love as vast as the universe, one tries to reduce the Divine to one’s own size and have His love for oneself alone.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Therefore, human love is not a need of the soul, but rather a concession it makes for a time to the ego.” (<span class="Character-Style-1 _idGenCharOverride-1">120</span>)</p>
