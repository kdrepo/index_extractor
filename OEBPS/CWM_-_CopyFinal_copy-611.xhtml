			<p class="body-text">“Naturally, dates are put on these old talks, but nobody pays any attention to the dates. How can they be mixed up with the things of today, which are on an entirely different plane?</p>
			<p class="body-text">There is an experience where you are altogether outside time, that is to say, in front, behind, above, below, it is all the same. In this identification, at the moment of identification, there is no more past or present or future. And in truth, this is the only way of knowing.</p>
			<p class="body-text">As the experiences develop, these old talks give me the impression of someone who walks all around a garden telling about what is there within it. But there comes a time when you enter into the garden and then you know a little better what is there. And I am beginning to enter. I am beginning.” <span class="Character-Style-1 _idGenCharOverride-1">18</span> July <span class="Character-Style-1 _idGenCharOverride-1">1960</span> (<span class="Character-Style-1 _idGenCharOverride-1">382</span>)</p>
