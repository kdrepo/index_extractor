			<p class="body-text">“Normally the consciousness of the departed ought to feel no pain for what happens to the body after his or her departure.But there is in the material body itself a consciousness called the “spirit of the form” which takes some time to get completely out of the aggregated cells; its departure is the starting point of a general decomposition, and before its departure it may have a kind of feeling of what happens to the body. That is why it is always better not to be in a hurry for the funeral.” <span class="Character-Style-1 _idGenCharOverride-1">13</span> November <span class="Character-Style-1 _idGenCharOverride-1">1966</span> (<span class="Character-Style-1 _idGenCharOverride-1">121</span>-<span class="Character-Style-1 _idGenCharOverride-1">22</span>)</p>
