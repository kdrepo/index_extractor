			<p class="body-text">“Lord, this morning Thou hast given me the assurance that Thou wouldst stay with us until Thy work is achieved, not only as a consciousness which guides and illumines but also as a dynamic Presence in action. In unmistakable terms Thou hast promised that all of Thyself would remain here and not leave the earth atmosphere until earth is transformed. Grant that we may be worthy of this marvellous Presence and that henceforth everything in us be concentrated on the one will to be more and more perfectly consecrated to the fulfilment of Thy sublime Work.” <span class="Character-Style-1 _idGenCharOverride-1">7</span> December <span class="Character-Style-1 _idGenCharOverride-1">1950</span> (<span class="Character-Style-1 _idGenCharOverride-1">6</span>)</p>

			<p class="body-text">“To Thee who hast been the material envelope of our Master, to Thee our infinite gratitude. Before Thee who hast done so much for us, who hast worked, struggled, suffered, hoped, endured so much, before Thee who hast willed all, attempted all, prepared, achieved all for us, before Thee we bow down and implore that we may never forget, even for a moment, all we owe to Thee.” <span class="Character-Style-1 _idGenCharOverride-1">9</span> December <span class="Character-Style-1 _idGenCharOverride-1">1950</span> (<span class="Character-Style-1 _idGenCharOverride-1">7</span>)</p>

I will not take it back. I shall manifest again in the first supramental body built in the supramental way.” <span class="Character-Style-1 _idGenCharOverride-1">11</span> April <span class="Character-Style-1 _idGenCharOverride-1">1952</span> (<span class="Character-Style-1 _idGenCharOverride-1">9</span>)</p>
