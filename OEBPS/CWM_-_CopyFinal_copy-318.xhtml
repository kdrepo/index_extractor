			<p class="body-text">“The conclusion is always the same: the only <a id="_idIndexMarker569"></a>true attitude is one of humility, of silent respect before what one does not know, and of inner aspiration to come out of one’s ignorance. One of the things which would make humanity progress most would be for it to respect what it does not know, to acknowledge willingly that it does not know and is therefore unable to judge. We constantly do just the opposite. We pass final judgments on things of which we have no knowledge whatsoever, and say in a peremptory manner, “This is possible. That is impossible,” when we do not even know what it is we are speaking of. And we put on superior airs because we doubt things of which we have never had any knowledge.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Men believe that doubt is a sign of superiority, whereas it is really a sign of inferiority.</p>
			<p class="body-text"><a id="_idIndexMarker570"></a>Scepticism and <a id="_idIndexMarker571"></a>doubt are two of the greatest obstacles to progress; they add presumptuousness to ignorance.” <br /><span class="Character-Style-1 _idGenCharOverride-1">21</span> November <span class="Character-Style-1 _idGenCharOverride-1">1958</span> (<span class="Character-Style-1 _idGenCharOverride-1">26</span>-<span class="Character-Style-1 _idGenCharOverride-1">27</span>)</p>
