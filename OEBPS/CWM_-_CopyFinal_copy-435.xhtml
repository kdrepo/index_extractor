			<p class="body-text">Never doubt such an experience. It is exactly the condition in which everybody ought to have been, the condition I was bringing down on the Ashram, and if it had been shared by all, nothing could have happened, all the most violent attacks would have been in vain.” <span class="Character-Style-1 _idGenCharOverride-1">1965</span> (<span class="Character-Style-1 _idGenCharOverride-1">125</span>)</p>
