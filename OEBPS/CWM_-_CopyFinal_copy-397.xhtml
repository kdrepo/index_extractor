			<p class="body-text">“Two things need to be done. Children must be taught:</p>
			<p class="body-text">a) not to tell a lie, whatever the consequences;</p>
			<p class="body-text">b) to control violence, rage, anger.</p>
			<p class="body-text">If these two things can be done, they can be led towards superhumanity.</p>
			<p class="body-text">There is an idea that if one breaks conventions, restrictions, one is free from the limitations of ordinary humanity. But this is wrong.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Those two things must be achieved to be able to be what may be called “superman”: not to tell lies and to control oneself.</p>
			<p class="body-text">A complete devotion to the Divine is the last condition, but these are the first two things to be achieved.”<span class="Character-Style-1 _idGenCharOverride-1">18</span> July <span class="Character-Style-1 _idGenCharOverride-1">1971</span> (<span class="Character-Style-1 _idGenCharOverride-1">155</span>)</p>
