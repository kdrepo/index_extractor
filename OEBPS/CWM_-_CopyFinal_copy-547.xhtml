			<p class="body-text">“If one looks at outer forms no longer in themselves, for themselves, in their appearance alone, but as the expression of a deeper and more abiding reality, then all of them – as well as all circumstances and events – become symbolic of the Force that is behind and that uses them for its self-expression.</p>
			<p class="body-text">For a certain state of consciousness, there is not a single circumstance, not a form, an action or a movement that is not expressive of a deeper or higher, more abiding, more essential and truer reality.” <span class="Character-Style-1 _idGenCharOverride-1">14</span> November <span class="Character-Style-1 _idGenCharOverride-1">1954</span> (<span class="Character-Style-1 _idGenCharOverride-1">7</span>)</p>
