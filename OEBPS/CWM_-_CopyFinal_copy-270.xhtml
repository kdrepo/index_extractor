			<p class="body-text">“The relation one has with Him will never have an equal, will never be exactly the same as another’s. No two are the same and therefore nothing can be taken away from you to be given to another, nothing can be withdrawn from you to be given to another. And if this relation disappeared from the creation, it would really disappear – which is impossible.</p>
			<p class="body-text">And this means that if one lives in the truth of one’s being, one is an indispensable part of the creation. Naturally, I don’t mean if one lives what one believes one should be, I am saying if one lives the truth of one’s being; if, by a development, one is able to enter into contact with the truth of one’s being, one is immediately in a unique and exclusive relation with the Divine, which hasn’t its equal.</p>
			<p class="body-text">There, now.</p>
			<p class="body-text">And naturally, because it is the truth of your being, that is what you should express in your life.” <span class="Character-Style-1 _idGenCharOverride-1">22</span> August <span class="Character-Style-1 _idGenCharOverride-1">1956</span> (<span class="Character-Style-1 _idGenCharOverride-1">280</span>)</p>
