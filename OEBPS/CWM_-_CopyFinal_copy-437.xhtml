			<p class="body-text">“First of all, from the financial point of view, the principle on which our action is based is the following: money is not meant to make money. This idea that money must make money is a falsehood and a perversion.</p>
			<p class="body-text"><a id="_idIndexMarker692"></a>Money is meant to increase the wealth, the prosperity and the productiveness of a group, a country or, better, of the whole earth. Money is a means, a force, a power, and not an end in itself. And like all forces and all powers, it is by movement and circulation that it grows and increases its power, not by accumulation and stagnation.</p>
			<p class="body-text">What we are attempting here is to prove to the world, by giving it a concrete example, that by inner psychological realisation and outer organisation a world can be created where most of the causes of human misery will be abolished.” <span class="Character-Style-1 _idGenCharOverride-1">24</span> April <span class="Character-Style-1 _idGenCharOverride-1">1938</span> (<span class="Character-Style-1 _idGenCharOverride-1">149</span>)</p>
