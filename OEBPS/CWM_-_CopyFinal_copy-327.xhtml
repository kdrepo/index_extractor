			<p class="MotherAphorism">“44 – Only those thoughts are true the opposite of which is also true in its own time and application; indisputable dogmas are the most dangerous kind of falsehoods.</p>
			<p class="question-Style">Why are indisputable dogmas the most dangerous ones?</p>
			<p class="body-text">The absolute, infinite, eternal Truth is unthinkable for the mind, which can conceive only what is spatial, temporal, fragmentary and limited.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Thus, on the mental plane the absolute Truth is divided into innumerable fragmentary and contradictory truths which, in their entirety, strive to reproduce, insofar as possible, the original Truth. </p>
			<p class="body-text">If one element of this totality is taken separately and affirmed as the only true one, however central or comprehensive it may be, it necessarily becomes a <a id="_idIndexMarker587"></a>falsehood, since it denies all the rest of the Total Truth.</p>
			<p class="body-text">This is precisely how indisputable dogmas are created and this is why they are the most dangerous kind of falsehood – because each one asserts that it is the sole truth to the exclusion of all other truths which, in their innumerable and complementary totality, express progressively, in the becoming, the infinite, eternal, absolute Truth.” <span class="Character-Style-1 _idGenCharOverride-1">27</span> August <span class="Character-Style-1 _idGenCharOverride-1">1960</span> (<span class="Character-Style-1 _idGenCharOverride-1">66</span>-<span class="Character-Style-1 _idGenCharOverride-1">67</span>)</p>
