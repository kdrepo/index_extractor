			<p class="body-text">What do you mean? Whether they were evolutionary beings or involutionary beings?</p>
			<p class="body-text">They were probably… no… they were surely <a id="_idIndexMarker462"></a>involutionary beings. But the body was the result of evolution.</p>
			<p class="body-text">But it is absolutely certain that they were involutionary beings, that is, beings who had come down from higher regions and used these bodies, who had identified themselves with these bodies.” <span class="Character-Style-1 _idGenCharOverride-1">2</span> November <span class="Character-Style-1 _idGenCharOverride-1">1955</span> (<span class="Character-Style-1 _idGenCharOverride-1">355</span>)</p>
