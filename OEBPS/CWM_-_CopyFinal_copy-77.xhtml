			<p class="body-text">“...an ill-directed, <a id="_idIndexMarker129"></a>ill-controlled thought does more harm than an enemy can do to an enemy or a hater to a hater. That is to say, even those who have the best intentions in the world, if they do not have a wise control over their thought, will do more harm to themselves and to those whom they love than an enemy can do to an enemy or a hater to a hater.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The mind has a power of deception in its own regard which is incalculable. It clothes its desires and preferences with all kinds of wonderful intentions and it hides its trickeries, resentments and disappointments under the most favourable appearances.</p>
			<p class="body-text">To overcome all that, you must have the fearlessness of a true warrior, and an honesty, a straightforwardness, a sincerity that never fail.” <span class="Character-Style-1 _idGenCharOverride-1">28</span> February <span class="Character-Style-1 _idGenCharOverride-1">1958</span> (<span class="Character-Style-1 _idGenCharOverride-1">211</span>-<span class="Character-Style-1 _idGenCharOverride-1">12</span>)</p>
