			<p class="body-text">“India is not the earth, rivers and mountains of this land, neither is it a collective name for the inhabitants of this country. India is a living being, as much living as, say, Shiva. India is a goddess as Shiva is a god. If she likes, she can manifest in human form.” (<span class="Character-Style-1 _idGenCharOverride-1">372</span>)</p>
