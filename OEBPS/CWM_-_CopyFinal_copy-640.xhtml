			<p class="question-Style">“H has had one of her usual disturbances. She wants me to tell you on her behalf: “I have given up hope, I have nothing in my fate except destruction.” </p>
			<p class="body-text">Yes, unhappily there is a vital love in her for you – it is that that has disturbed her balance, aroused in her this violent jealousy and brought upon her, as a consequence, all these fits of depression. But now no drastic or cutting way can lead out of the difficulty. It is by a growth of consciousness that this entanglement can be solved.” <span class="Character-Style-1 _idGenCharOverride-1">21</span> September <span class="Character-Style-1 _idGenCharOverride-1">1935</span> (<span class="Character-Style-1 _idGenCharOverride-1">119</span>)</p>
