			<p class="body-text">“O Thou whom at first sight I knew for the Lord of my being and my God, receive my offering.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Thine are all my thoughts, all my emotions, all the sentiments of my heart, all my sensations, all the movements of my life, each cell of my body, each drop of my blood. I am absolutely and altogether Thine, Thine without reserve. What Thou wilt of me, that I shall be. Whether Thou choosest for me life or death, happiness or sorrow, pleasure or suffering, all that comes to me from Thee will be welcome. Each one of Thy gifts will be always for me a gift divine bringing with it the supreme Felicity.” <br /><span class="Character-Style-1 _idGenCharOverride-1">13</span> January <span class="Character-Style-1 _idGenCharOverride-1">1932</span> (<span class="Character-Style-1 _idGenCharOverride-1">210</span>)</p>
