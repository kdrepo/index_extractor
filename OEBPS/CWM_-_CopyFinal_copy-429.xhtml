			<p class="body-text">“It is quite inexact that in my consciousness there is a will to be late. The truth is that the will to be ready in time does not take precedence in me over the other wills: it is in its place among the others, not exclusive and unique but forming part of the whole in which degrees of greatness and importance may not conform to what you think or feel. In fact, your sense of relative importance is not the same as mine. Moreover, you consider the problem in a linear and exclusive way, as if it were separate from other accompanying problems. It is nothing of the kind; each problem exists not in itself but in relation to all the others; and in order to be true, the solution must not neglect any of them.</p>
			<p class="body-text">If you can understand that, your difficulty is sure to disappear easily.” <span class="Character-Style-1 _idGenCharOverride-1">16</span> November <span class="Character-Style-1 _idGenCharOverride-1">1950</span> (<span class="Character-Style-1 _idGenCharOverride-1">90</span>)</p>
