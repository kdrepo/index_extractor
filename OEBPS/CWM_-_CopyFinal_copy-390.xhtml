			<p class="body-text">“..the <a id="_idIndexMarker664"></a>vital has three sources of subsistence. The one most easily accessible to it comes from below, from the physical energies through the sensations.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The second is on its own plane, when it is sufficiently vast and receptive, by contact with the universal vital forces.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The third, to which it usually opens only in a great aspiration for progress, comes to it from above by the infusion and absorption of spiritual forces and inspiration.</p>
			<p class="body-text">To these sources men always strive more or less to add another, which is for them at the same time the source of most of their torments and misfortunes. It is the interchange of vital forces with their fellows, usually in groups of two, which they most often mistake for love, but which is only the attraction between two forces that take pleasure in mutual interchange.” Bulletin, February <span class="Character-Style-1 _idGenCharOverride-1">1953</span> (<span class="Character-Style-1 _idGenCharOverride-1">55</span>)</p>
