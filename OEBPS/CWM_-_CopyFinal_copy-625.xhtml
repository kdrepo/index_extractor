			<p class="question-Style">“Sweet Mother,</p>
			<p class="question-Style">What is meant by “a subtle physical prolongation of the superficial form of the mental envelope”?</p>
			<p class="body-text">It means that the ghost one sees and wrongly takes for the departed being itself, is only an image of it, an imprint (like a photographic imprint) left in the subtle physical by the superficial mental form, an image that can become visible under certain conditions. These images can move about (like cinema images), but they have no substantial reality. It is the fear or emotion of those who see these images that sometimes gives them the appearance of a power or an action they do not possess in themselves. Hence the necessity of never being afraid and of recognising them for what they are – a deceptive appearance.” <span class="Character-Style-1 _idGenCharOverride-1">14</span> September, <span class="Character-Style-1 _idGenCharOverride-1">1959</span> (<span class="Character-Style-1 _idGenCharOverride-1">223</span>)</p>
