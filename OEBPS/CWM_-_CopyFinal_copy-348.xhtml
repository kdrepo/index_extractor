			<p class="body-text">“One could, if one wanted to, make prophecies by saying what has been seen. But there is a kind of super-compassion which prevents this prophecy, because the Word of Truth has a power of manifestation and to express the result of the resistance would make that state concrete and diminish the action of the <a id="_idIndexMarker615"></a>Grace. That is why even when one sees, one cannot speak, one must not speak.” <span class="Character-Style-1 _idGenCharOverride-1">6</span> July <span class="Character-Style-1 _idGenCharOverride-1">1966</span> (<span class="Character-Style-1 _idGenCharOverride-1">232</span>)</p>
