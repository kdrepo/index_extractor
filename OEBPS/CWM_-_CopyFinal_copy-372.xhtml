			<p class="question-Style">Everything decided.</p>
			<p class="body-text">And everything has its reason for existence, which eludes us because our vision is not wide enough.</p>
			<p class="body-text">And you understand, life, existence, indeed the world itself would have no sense if it were otherwise.</p>
			<p class="question-Style">Yes.</p>

Yes, it is a thing I see.” <span class="Character-Style-1 _idGenCharOverride-1">31</span> January <span class="Character-Style-1 _idGenCharOverride-1">1970</span> (<span class="Character-Style-1 _idGenCharOverride-1">221</span>)</p>
