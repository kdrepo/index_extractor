			<p class="body-text">“One who has won inner peace is a herald of deliverance wherever he goes, a bearer of hope and joy. Is not this what poor and suffering humanity needs above all things?</p>
			<p class="body-text">Yes, there are certain men whose thoughts are all love, who radiate love, and the mere presence of these individuals is a charity more active, more real than any other.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Though they utter no word and make no gesture, yet the sick are relieved, the tormented are soothed, the ignorant are enlightened, the wicked are appeased, those who suffer are consoled and all undergo this deep transformation which will open new horizons to them, enable them to take a step forward which no doubt will be decisive, on the infinite path of progress.</p>
			<p class="body-text">These individuals who, out of love, give themselves to all, who become the servants of all, are the living symbols of the supreme Charity.” <span class="Character-Style-1 _idGenCharOverride-1">20</span> May <span class="Character-Style-1 _idGenCharOverride-1">1912</span> (<span class="Character-Style-1 _idGenCharOverride-1">105</span>-<span class="Character-Style-1 _idGenCharOverride-1">06</span>)</p>
