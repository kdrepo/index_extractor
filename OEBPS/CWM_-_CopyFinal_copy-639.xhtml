			<p class="question-Style">“Dear Mother, </p>
			<p class="question-Style">I do not find it difficult to deal with F. I believe that I can exert a good influence upon her and bring her back to You. Arrange that we may come in contact with each other under the pretext of work or anything You like. I know that if I go, I am surrounded with Your love and protection. I dare to do so because You have kept me in the protection of Your love.</p>
			<p class="body-text">It is true that the <a id="_idIndexMarker814"></a>divine protection is always around us, but it works completely only when we are faced by dangers which were unavoidable; that is to say, when doing some work for the Divine if dangers suddenly rise on the way then the protection works at its best. But to take up some work that is, after all, not at all indispensable and not even surely useful and which is extremely dangerous, counting on the divine protection to save us from all possible consequences, this is a movement which is like a challenge to the Divine, and the Divine will never agree to it. </p>
			<p class="body-text">I will explain myself – if it were indispensable that you should learn her work (which is, in fact, not only not indispensable but absurdly useless) and if F was the only person who could teach you (which is not the case, because H knows almost as well as she does) then we could overlook the very real dangers that await you by meeting F regularly, and this meeting could perhaps, with the Divine’s help and protection, have some good results for F. </p>
			<p class="body-text">But to pretend to learn the work only with the purpose of acting on F’s character, is putting a worm of insincerity in the very seed of the action and can only have disastrous results. </p>
