			<p class="body-text">“<a id="_idIndexMarker677"></a>Compulsion is neither the best nor the most effective principle of education.</p>
			<p class="body-text">True education must&#160;reveal&#160;what is already present in the developing beings and make it blossom. Just as flowers blossom in the sun, children blossom in joy. It goes without saying that joy does not mean weakness, disorder and confusion. But a luminous kindliness which encourages the good and does not severely insist on the bad.</p>
