			<p class="body-text">“According to my experience, the soul is divine, an eternal portion of the Supreme Divine, and therefore it cannot be limited or bound by any law whatever, except its own. These souls are emanated by the Lord to do His work in the world, and each one comes on earth with a particular purpose, for a particular work, and with a particular destiny; each has its own law which is binding on itself alone and cannot be made a general rule.</p>
			<p class="body-text">So in the eternity of the becoming, every possible case, imaginable and unimaginable, must obviously occur.” <span class="Character-Style-1 _idGenCharOverride-1">14</span> July <span class="Character-Style-1 _idGenCharOverride-1">1960</span> (<span class="Character-Style-1 _idGenCharOverride-1">356</span>)</p>
