Why? – because they were in the company of liars; there was an atmosphere of falsehood and they had quite simply caught the malady!” <br /><span class="Character-Style-1 _idGenCharOverride-1">13</span> January <span class="Character-Style-1 _idGenCharOverride-1">1951</span> (<span class="Character-Style-1 _idGenCharOverride-1">37</span>)</p>
