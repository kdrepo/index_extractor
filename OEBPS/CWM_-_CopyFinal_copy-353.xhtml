			<p class="question-Style">“Since the supramental consciousness is at work on earth, won’t these miserable conditions change in spite of everything?</p>
			<p class="body-text">Naturally, the first effect will be a change of consciousness, first among the most receptive, and then in a greater number of people.</p>
			<p class="body-text">A change in the general conditions of collective life can only come later, perhaps long after individual reactions have been transformed. The first noticeable result is a heightening of the general confusion, because the old principles have lost their authority, and men (except for a very few) are not ready to obey the Divine Command, because they are incapable of perceiving it.” <span class="Character-Style-1 _idGenCharOverride-1">1</span> March <span class="Character-Style-1 _idGenCharOverride-1">1970</span> (<span class="Character-Style-1 _idGenCharOverride-1">314</span>)</p>
