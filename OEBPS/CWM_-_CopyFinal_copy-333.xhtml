			<p class="body-text">“Whatever the image – what we disdainfully call an <a id="_idIndexMarker600"></a>idol – whatever the external form of the deity, even if to our physical eye it appears ugly or commonplace or horrible, a caricature, there is always within it the presence of the thing it represents. And there is always someone, a priest or an initiate, or a sadhu, a sannyasin, who has the power and who draws – this is usually the work of the priests – who draws the force, the presence within. And it is real: it is quite true that the force, the presence is there; and it is that, not the form of wood or stone or metal, which people worship – it is the presence.</p>
			<p class="body-text">But people in Europe do not have this inner sense, not at all. For them everything is like a surface – not even that, just a thin outer film with nothing behind – so they cannot feel it. And yet it is a fact that the presence is there; it is an absolutely real fact, I guarantee it.” <span class="Character-Style-1 _idGenCharOverride-1">26</span> April <span class="Character-Style-1 _idGenCharOverride-1">1961</span> (<span class="Character-Style-1 _idGenCharOverride-1">95</span>)</p>
