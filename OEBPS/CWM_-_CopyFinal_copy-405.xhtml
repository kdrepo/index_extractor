			<p class="body-text">“To be repeated each day by all the students:</p>
			<p class="body-text">It is not for our family, it is not to secure a good position, it is not to earn money, it is not to obtain a diploma, that we study.</p>
			<p class="body-text">We study to learn, to know, to understand the world, and for the sake of the joy that it gives us.” June <span class="Character-Style-1 _idGenCharOverride-1">1967</span> (<span class="Character-Style-1 _idGenCharOverride-1">200</span>)</p>
