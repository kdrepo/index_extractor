			<p class="body-text">“Sri Aurobindo incarnated in a human body the supramental consciousness and has not only revealed to us the nature of the path to follow and the method of following it so as to arrive at the goal, but has also by his own personal realisation given us the example; he has provided us with the proof that the thing can be done and the time is now to do it.” (<span class="Character-Style-1 _idGenCharOverride-1">21</span>)</p>
			<p class="star-single-center">***</p>
			<p class="body-text">“Never for an instant vacillate in the belief that the mighty work of change taken up by Sri Aurobindo is going to culminate in success. For that indeed is a fact: there is not a shadow of doubt as to the issue of the work we have in hand…. The transformation is going to be: nothing will ever stop it, nothing will frustrate the decree of the Omnipotent. Cast away all diffidence and weakness and resolve to endure bravely awhile before the great day arrives when the long battle turns into an everlasting victory.” (<span class="Character-Style-1 _idGenCharOverride-1">21</span>)</p>
			<p class="star-single-center">***</p>
			<p class="body-text">“If one reads Sri Aurobindo carefully one finds the answers to all that one wants to know.” <span class="Character-Style-1 _idGenCharOverride-1">25</span> October <span class="Character-Style-1 _idGenCharOverride-1">1972</span> (<span class="Character-Style-1 _idGenCharOverride-1">24</span>)</p>
