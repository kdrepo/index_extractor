			<p class="body-text">“...if you say, “I can do nothing, that belongs to Nature, the movement has to follow its natural course”, you do exactly what I have told you not to do, you make use of the Divine as a fine cloak to cover the satisfaction of your desires. But the opposite movement, “I am good for nothing because such an idea has crossed my mind” is equally wrong, isn’t it? </p>
			<p class="body-text">Naturally, if an impulse happens to come to you which you do not want, the first thing to do is to will that it does not come again; but if, on the contrary, you do not sincerely want it to disappear, then keep it, but do not try to do yoga. You should not take the path unless you have resolved beforehand to overcome all difficulties. The decision must be sincere and complete. You will notice, besides, as you gradually advance, that what you believed to be complete is not so, what you considered to be sincere is not so, and then you will progress little by little; but to succeed you must have as total a will for progress as possible. If you have this will and if an impulse seizes you with violence, keep the will firm, your being must not vacillate; you must expect these things to come, but when they come, tell yourself, “Well, they come from below, I do not want them to recur, they are not mine.” This is not the same thing as saying, “Let it go, since it is Nature.”</p>
			<p class="body-text">There must already be a beginning of realisation in the vital for it to revolt against the impulses that come to it.” <span class="Character-Style-1 _idGenCharOverride-1">5</span> February <span class="Character-Style-1 _idGenCharOverride-1">1951</span> (<span class="Character-Style-1 _idGenCharOverride-1">77</span>-<span class="Character-Style-1 _idGenCharOverride-1">78</span>)</p>
