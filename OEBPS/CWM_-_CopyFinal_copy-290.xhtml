			<p class="body-text">“There are people who love adventure. It is these I call, and I tell them this: “I invite you to the great adventure.”</p>
			<p class="body-text">It is not a question of repeating spiritually what others have done before us, for our adventure begins beyond that. It is a question of a new creation, entirely new, with all the unforeseen events, the risks, the hazards it entails – a real adventure, whose goal is certain victory, but the road to which is unknown and must be traced out step by step in the unexplored. Something that has never been in this present universe and that will never be again in the same way. If that interests you… well, let us embark. What will happen to you tomorrow – I have no idea.</p>
			<p class="body-text">One must put aside all that has been foreseen, all that has been devised, all that has been constructed, and then… set off walking into the unknown. And – come what may! There.” <br /><span class="Character-Style-1 _idGenCharOverride-1">10</span> July <span class="Character-Style-1 _idGenCharOverride-1">1957</span> (<span class="Character-Style-1 _idGenCharOverride-1">152</span>)</p>
