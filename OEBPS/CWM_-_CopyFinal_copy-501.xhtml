			<p class="body-text">“True love has no need of reciprocation; there can be no reciprocation because there is only one Love, the Love, which has no other aim than to love. It is in the world of division that one feels the need of reciprocation – because one lives in the illusion of the multiplicity of Love; but in fact there is only One Love and it is always this sole love which, so to say, responds to itself.” <span class="Character-Style-1 _idGenCharOverride-1">19</span> April <span class="Character-Style-1 _idGenCharOverride-1">1967</span> (<span class="Character-Style-1 _idGenCharOverride-1">122</span>-<span class="Character-Style-1 _idGenCharOverride-1">23</span>)</p>
