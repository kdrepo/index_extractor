			<p class="body-text">“...two things prepare people the most. They are born with one or the other; and if they take the trouble, it develops gradually, it increases.</p>
			<p class="body-text">We say: the capacity for enthusiasm, something which throws you out of your miserable and mean little ego; and the generous <a id="_idIndexMarker467"></a>gratitude, the generosity of the gratitude which also flings itself in thanksgiving out of the little ego. These are the <a id="_idIndexMarker468"></a>two most powerful levers to enter into contact with the Divine in one’s psychic being. This serves as a link with the psychic being – the surest link.” <span class="Character-Style-1 _idGenCharOverride-1">28</span> December <span class="Character-Style-1 _idGenCharOverride-1">1955</span> (<span class="Character-Style-1 _idGenCharOverride-1">418</span>-<span class="Character-Style-1 _idGenCharOverride-1">19</span>)</p>
