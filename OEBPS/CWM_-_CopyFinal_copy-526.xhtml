			<p class="body-text">“There can be no physical life without an order and rhythm. When this order is changed it must be in obedience to an inner growth and not for the sake of external novelty. It is only a certain part of the surface lower vital nature which seeks always external change and novelty for its own sake.</p>
			<p class="body-text">It is by a constant inner growth that one can find a constant newness and unfailing interest in life. There is no other satisfying way.” <span class="Character-Style-1 _idGenCharOverride-1">22</span> October <span class="Character-Style-1 _idGenCharOverride-1">1964</span> (<span class="Character-Style-1 _idGenCharOverride-1">216</span>)</p>
