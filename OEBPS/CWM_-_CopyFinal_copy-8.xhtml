			<p class="body-text">“IN the presence of those who are integrally Thy servitors, those who have attained the perfect consciousness of Thy presence, I become aware that I am still far, very far from what I yearn to realise; and I know that the highest I can conceive, the noblest and purest is still dark and ignorant beside what I should conceive. But this perception, far from being depressing, stimulates and strengthens the aspiration, the energy, the will to triumph over all obstacles so as to be at last identified with Thy law and Thy work.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Gradually the horizon becomes distinct, the path grows clear, and we move towards a greater and greater certitude.</p>
			<p class="body-text">It matters little that there are thousands of beings plunged in the densest ignorance, He whom we saw yesterday is on earth; his presence is enough to prove that a day will come when darkness shall be transformed into light, and Thy reign shall be indeed established upon earth.</p>
			<p class="body-text">O Lord, Divine Builder of this marvel, my heart overflows with joy and gratitude when I think of it, and my hope has no bounds.</p>
			<p class="body-text">My adoration is beyond all words, my reverence is silent.” (<span class="Character-Style-1 _idGenCharOverride-1">113</span>)</p>
