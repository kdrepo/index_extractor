			<p class="body-text">“Nothing is inevitable. At every moment an intervention may come from a higher plane into the material one and alter the course of circumstances. But in this particular case there is a conflict between a very powerful mental construction founded on medical opinion and your faith in the <a id="_idIndexMarker809"></a>divine Grace.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The power of this medical suggestion lies in the fact that it insinuates itself into the subconscious and acts on the body from there, undetected even by the conscious mind unless it is in the habit of scouring the subconscious with the vigilance of a detective.</p>
			<p class="body-text">So there we are – I cannot promise you that your faith in the Grace will be intense and unshakable enough to overcome the harmful effect of these <a id="_idIndexMarker810"></a>medical suggestions; and I feel that I have no right to tell you, “It is nothing,” when everything in your material consciousness is crying out, “Danger!”</p>
			<p class="body-text">Rest assured that our help and our blessings are always with you.” <span class="Character-Style-1 _idGenCharOverride-1">24</span> March <span class="Character-Style-1 _idGenCharOverride-1">1937</span> (<span class="Character-Style-1 _idGenCharOverride-1">187</span>)</p>
