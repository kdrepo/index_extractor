			<p class="body-text">“Sleep is the school one must pass through if one knows how to learn one’s lesson there, so that the inner being may become independent of the physical form, conscious in its own right and master of its own life. There are entire parts of the being that need this immobility and semi-consciousness of the outer being, of the body, in order to be able to lead their own life independently.</p>
			<p class="body-text">It is another school for another result, but it is still a school. If one wants to achieve the maximum possible progress, one must know how to make use of one’s nights just as one makes use of one’s days. Only, people usually have no idea how to go about it; they try to stay awake and all they achieve is a physical and vital imbalance, and sometimes a mental one too.” <span class="Character-Style-1 _idGenCharOverride-1">25</span> January <span class="Character-Style-1 _idGenCharOverride-1">1938</span> (<span class="Character-Style-1 _idGenCharOverride-1">131</span>)</p>
