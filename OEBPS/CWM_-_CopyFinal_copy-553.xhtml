			<p class="body-text">“In the terrestrial organisation, the world of insects is, so to say, the direct work of hostile creators in the vital world; they are the result of adverse and often diabolical thoughts and imaginations, directed not towards man but towards the divine work. Often an insect that looks quite harmless is the messenger of a bad and malevolent will; in that case one must deal severely with it.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Love can tolerate anything – but in action, the Divine chooses and decides. Yet even in his act of destruction, there shines out pure Love, sublime Love.” <span class="Character-Style-1 _idGenCharOverride-1">14</span> October <span class="Character-Style-1 _idGenCharOverride-1">1955</span> (<span class="Character-Style-1 _idGenCharOverride-1">22</span>)</p>
