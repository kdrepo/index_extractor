			<p class="body-text">“We always call “Divine” all that we are not but wish to be. All that seems to us infinitely superior, not only to all that we have done, but to all that we feel we can do; all that surpasses both our conception and our present possibilities, we call “Divine”.</p>
			<p class="body-text">I say this, not as a joke, but because I am quite convinced that if we go back some thousands of years, when men spoke of the Divine – if ever they did speak of the Divine, as I believe – they spoke perhaps of a state like that of the godheads of the Overmind; and now this mode of being of the Overmind godheads who, obviously, have governed the earth and formed many things on earth for a very long time, seems to us far inferior to what we conceive the Supermind to be. And this Supermind, which is, precisely, what we now call the Divine and try to bring down on earth, will probably strike us in the same way a few thousand or million years hence as the Overmind does today.</p>
			<p class="body-text">And I am sure that in the manifestation, that is, in His self-expression, the Divine is progressive. Outside the manifestation He is something we cannot conceive; but as soon as He manifests in this kind of perpetual being, well, He manifests more and more of Himself, as though He were reserving for the end the most beautiful things in His Being.</p>
			<p class="body-text">As the world progresses, what He expresses in the world becomes what we might call more and more divine.” <span class="Character-Style-1 _idGenCharOverride-1">25</span> January <span class="Character-Style-1 _idGenCharOverride-1">1956</span> (<span class="Character-Style-1 _idGenCharOverride-1">33</span>-<span class="Character-Style-1 _idGenCharOverride-1">34</span>)</p>
