			<p class="body-text">“On the physical plane the Divine expresses himself through beauty, on the mental plane through knowledge, on the vital plane through power and on the psychic plane through love.</p>
			<p class="body-text">When we rise high enough, we discover that these four aspects unite with each other in a single consciousness, full of love, luminous, powerful, beautiful, containing all, pervading all. </p>
			<p class="body-text">It is only to satisfy the universal play that this consciousness divides itself into several lines or aspects of manifestation.” <span class="Character-Style-1 _idGenCharOverride-1">29</span> March <span class="Character-Style-1 _idGenCharOverride-1">1934</span> (<span class="Character-Style-1 _idGenCharOverride-1">6</span>)</p>
