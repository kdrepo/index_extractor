			<p class="body-text">“We may say that perfection will be attained in the individual, the collectivity, on the earth and in the universe, when, at every moment, the receptivity will be equal in quality and quantity to the Force which wants to manifest.</p>
			<p class="body-text">That is the supreme equilibrium.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Hence, there must be a perfect equilibrium between what comes from above and what answers from below, and when the two meet, that is perfect equilibrium, which is the Realisation – a realisation in constant progress.” <span class="Character-Style-1 _idGenCharOverride-1">30</span> December <span class="Character-Style-1 _idGenCharOverride-1">1950</span> (<span class="Character-Style-1 _idGenCharOverride-1">16</span>)</p>
