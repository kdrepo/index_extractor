			<p class="MotherAphorism">“175 – Because a good man dies or fails and the evil live and triumph, is God therefore evil? I do not see the logic of the consequence. I must first be convinced that death and failure are evil; I sometimes think that when they come, they are our supreme momentary good. But we are the fools of our hearts and nerves and argue that what they do not like or desire, must of course be an evil!</p>
			<p class="question-Style">But what about those who are unlucky and always fail in everything they do?</p>
			<p class="body-text">First, once and for all, you should know that <a id="_idIndexMarker618"></a>luck, good or bad, does not exist.</p>
			<p class="body-text">What to our ignorance looks like luck is simply the result of causes we know nothing about.</p>
			<p class="body-text">It is certain that for someone who has desires, when his desires are not satisfied, it is a sign that the <a id="_idIndexMarker619"></a>Divine Grace is with him and wants, through experience, to make him progress rapidly, by teaching him that a willing and spontaneous surrender to the Divine Will is a much surer way to be happy in peace and light than the satisfaction of any desire.” <span class="Character-Style-1 _idGenCharOverride-1">17</span> October <span class="Character-Style-1 _idGenCharOverride-1">1969</span> (<span class="Character-Style-1 _idGenCharOverride-1">261</span>)</p>
