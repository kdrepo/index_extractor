			<p class="body-text">“One might say that the <a id="_idIndexMarker558"></a>soul is a delegation of the <a id="_idIndexMarker559"></a>spirit in mankind, a special help to lead it faster. It is the soul that makes individual progress possible. The spirit, in its original form, has a more general, more collective action.</p>
			<p class="body-text">For the moment the spirit plays the part of a helper and guide, but it is not the all-powerful master of the material manifestation; when the Supermind is organised into a new world, the spirit will become the master and govern Nature in a clear and visible way.</p>
			<p class="body-text">What is called “new birth” is the birth into the spiritual life, the spiritual consciousness; it is to carry in oneself something of the spirit which, individually, through the soul, can begin to rule the life and be the master of existence. But in the supramental world, the spirit will be the master of this entire world and all its manifestations, all its expressions, consciously, spontaneously, naturally.” <span class="Character-Style-1 _idGenCharOverride-1">26</span> November <span class="Character-Style-1 _idGenCharOverride-1">1958</span> (<span class="Character-Style-1 _idGenCharOverride-1">429</span>-<span class="Character-Style-1 _idGenCharOverride-1">30</span>)</p>
