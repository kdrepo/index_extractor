			<p class="body-text">“All that does not want the Divine creates this atmosphere purposely to discourage those who want the Divine. You must… you must not pay attention. That, that is the way of the devil. <a id="_idIndexMarker637"></a>Pessimism is the demon’s weapon and he senses his situation (gesture of shaking). Well, if what I see as possible is realised, it will be truly a decisive victory over the adverse forces – naturally, he defends himself as best he can…. That, it is always the devil; as soon as you see even the tail of pessimism, it is the devil. That is his great weapon.” <span class="Character-Style-1 _idGenCharOverride-1">22</span> May <span class="Character-Style-1 _idGenCharOverride-1">1971</span> (<span class="Character-Style-1 _idGenCharOverride-1">256</span>-<span class="Character-Style-1 _idGenCharOverride-1">57</span>)</p>
