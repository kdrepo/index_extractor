			<p class="MotherAphorism">“5 – If mankind only caught a glimpse of what infinite enjoyments, what perfect forces, what luminous reaches of spontaneous knowledge, what wide calms of our being lie waiting for us in the tracts which our animal evolution has not yet conquered, they would leave all and never rest till they had gained these treasures. But the way is narrow, the doors are hard to force, and <a id="_idIndexMarker563"></a>fear, <a id="_idIndexMarker564"></a>distrust and <a id="_idIndexMarker565"></a>scepticism are there, sentinels of Nature, to forbid the turning away of our feet from her ordinary pastures.</p>
			<p class="body-text">...When you have truly had enough of it and want things to be different, then you have the courage, the strength, the capacity to conquer these three terrible enemies: fear, doubt and scepticism. But I repeat, it is not enough to sit down one fine day, watch yourself be, and struggle with these things inside you once and for all. You have to do it and do it again and again and continue in a way which seems almost endless, to be sure that you have got rid of it all. In reality, you are perhaps never truly rid of it, but there comes a time when inside yourself, you are so different that you can no longer be touched by these things. You can see them, but you see them with a smile, and at a simple gesture they go away, back to where they came from, perhaps a little changed, perhaps a little less strong, less obstinate, less aggressive – until the time when the Light is so strong that all darkness vanishes.” <span class="Character-Style-1 _idGenCharOverride-1">10</span> October <span class="Character-Style-1 _idGenCharOverride-1">1958</span> (<span class="Character-Style-1 _idGenCharOverride-1">10</span>-<span class="Character-Style-1 _idGenCharOverride-1">14</span>)</p>
