			<p class="body-text">“<a id="_idIndexMarker747"></a>Krishna represents both the universal Godhead and the immanent Godhead, he whom one can meet within one’s being and in all that constitutes the manifested world.</p>
			<p class="body-text">And do you want to know why he is always represented as a child? It is because he is in constant progression. To the extent that the world is perfected, his play is also perfected – what was the play of yesterday will no longer be the play of tomorrow; his play will become more and more harmonious, benign and joyful to the extent that the world becomes capable of responding to it and enjoying it with the Divine.” (<span class="Character-Style-1 _idGenCharOverride-1">14</span>)</p>
