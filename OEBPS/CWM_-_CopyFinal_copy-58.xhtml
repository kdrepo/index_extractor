			<p class="body-text">“When you come to the <a id="_idIndexMarker071"></a>Yoga, you must be ready to have all your mental buildings and all your vital scaffoldings shattered to pieces. You must be prepared to be suspended in the air with nothing to support you except your faith. You will have to forget your past self and its clingings altogether, to pluck it out of your consciousness and be born anew, free from every kind of bondage. Think not of what you were, but of what you aspire to be; be altogether in what you want to realise. Turn from your dead past and look straight towards the future. Your religion, country, family lie there; it is the DIVINE.” <span class="Character-Style-1 _idGenCharOverride-1">9</span> June <span class="Character-Style-1 _idGenCharOverride-1">1929</span> (<span class="Character-Style-1 _idGenCharOverride-1">83</span>-<span class="Character-Style-1 _idGenCharOverride-1">84</span>)</p>
