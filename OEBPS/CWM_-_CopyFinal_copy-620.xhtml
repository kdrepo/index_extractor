			<p class="body-text">“I believe in the superiority of the inner vision over the outer vision and this belief is based not merely on theoretical knowledge but on the thousands of examples I have come across in the course of a life which is already long. Unfortunately I am surrounded by people who, though they are here to practise yoga, are still convinced that “a cat is a cat”, as we commonly say in French, and that one can rely only on one’s physical eyes for seeing and observing, on one’s physical-mental knowledge for judging and deciding, and that the laws of Nature are laws – in other words, any exception to them is a miracle. This is false.</p>
			<p class="body-text">This is what is at the root of all the misunderstandings and reservations. You already know, and I mention it only to remind you, that an experiment made in a spirit of reserve and doubt is not an experiment, and that outer circumstances will always conspire to justify these doubts, and this for a reason which is very easy to understand: doubt veils the consciousness and the subconscious sincerity, and into the action some small factors creep in which may seem unimportant, but which are just sufficient to alter all the factors of the problem and to bring about the result that one had anticipated by doubting.” <span class="Character-Style-1 _idGenCharOverride-1">7</span> June, <span class="Character-Style-1 _idGenCharOverride-1">1934</span> (<span class="Character-Style-1 _idGenCharOverride-1">40</span>-<span class="Character-Style-1 _idGenCharOverride-1">41</span>)</p>
