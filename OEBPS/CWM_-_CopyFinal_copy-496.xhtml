			<p class="body-text">“It may be said that at its origin love is the supreme power of attraction which awakens, in response, the irresistible need of an absolute self-giving; they are the two poles of the urge towards complete fusion.</p>
			<p class="body-text">No other movement could, better and more surely than this, throw a bridge across the abyss dug by the sense of separation that comes from the formation of the individual. It was necessary to bring back to itself what had been projected into space without destroying for this purpose the universe created thus.</p>
			<p class="body-text">That is why love sprang up, the irresistible power of union.” (<span class="Character-Style-1 _idGenCharOverride-1">118</span>)</p>
