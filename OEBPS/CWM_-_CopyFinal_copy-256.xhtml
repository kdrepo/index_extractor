			<p class="body-text">“...we put surrender first, at the top of the list, that is, we accept what Sri Aurobindo has said – that to do the integral yoga one must first resolve to surrender entirely to the Divine, there is no other way, this is the way. But after that one must have the five psychological virtues, five psychological perfections, and we say that these perfections are:</p>
			<p class="body-text">Sincerity or Transparency</p>
			<p class="body-text">Faith or Trust (Trust in the Divine, naturally)</p>
			<p class="body-text">Devotion or Gratitude</p>
			<p class="body-text">Courage or Aspiration</p>
			<p class="body-text">Endurance or Perseverance.</p>
			<p class="body-text">One form of endurance is faithfulness, faithfulness to one’s resolution – being faithful. One has taken a resolution, one is faithful to one’s resolution. This is endurance.</p>
			<p class="body-text">There you are.</p>
			<p class="body-text">If one persists, there comes a time when one is victorious.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Victory is to the most persistent.” <span class="Character-Style-1 _idGenCharOverride-1">25</span> January <span class="Character-Style-1 _idGenCharOverride-1">1956</span> (<span class="Character-Style-1 _idGenCharOverride-1">42</span>)</p>
