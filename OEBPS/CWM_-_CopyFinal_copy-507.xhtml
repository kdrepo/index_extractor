			<p class="body-text">“To be humble means for the mind, the vital and the body never to forget that without the Divine they know nothing, are nothing and can do nothing; without the Divine they are nothing but ignorance, chaos and impotence. The Divine alone is Truth, Life, Power, Love, Felicity.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Therefore the mind, the vital, and the body must learn and feel, once and for all, that they are wholly incapable of understanding and judging the Divine, not only in his essence but also in his action and manifestation.</p>
			<p class="body-text">This is the only true humility and with it come quiet and peace.</p>
			<p class="body-text">This is also the surest shield against all hostile attack. Indeed, in the human being it is always the door of pride at which the Adversary knocks, for it is this door which opens to let him enter.” (<span class="Character-Style-1 _idGenCharOverride-1">152</span>-<span class="Character-Style-1 _idGenCharOverride-1">53</span>)</p>
