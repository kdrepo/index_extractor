			<p class="body-text">“From the point of view of a spiritual life, it is not what you do that matters most, but the way in which it is done and the consciousness you put into it. Remember always the Divine and all you do will be an expression of the Divine Presence.</p>
			<p class="body-text">When all your actions are consecrated to the Divine, there will be no longer activities that are superior and activities that are inferior; all will have an equal importance – the value given them by the consecration.” (<span class="Character-Style-1 _idGenCharOverride-1">36</span>)</p>
