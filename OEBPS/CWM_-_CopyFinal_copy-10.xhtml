			<p class="body-text">“O DIVINE and adorable Mother, with Thy help what is there that is impossible? The hour of realisations is near and Thou hast assured us of Thy aid that we may perform integrally the supreme Will. </p>
			<p class="body-text">Thou hast accepted us as fit intermediaries between the unthinkable realities and the relativities of the physical world, and Thy constant presence in our midst is a token of Thy active collaboration.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The Lord has willed and Thou dost execute: </p>
			<p class="body-text">A new Light shall break upon the earth.<br />A new world shall be born,<br />And the things that were promised shall be fulfilled.” (<span class="Character-Style-1 _idGenCharOverride-1">252</span>)</p>
