			<p class="body-text">“There comes a time when really one can no longer say anything: one has the feeling that whatever one says, even if it isn’t absolutely inane, is not far short of it, and that it would actually be better to keep quiet. That is the difficulty. In some of these Aphorisms you feel that he has suddenly caught hold of something above and beyond everything that can be thought – so what can one say?</p>
			<p class="star-single-center">(Silence)</p>
			<p class="body-text">Naturally, when one comes down here again, one can – oh, one can say many things!</p>
			<p class="body-text">As a joke – one can always joke, but one hesitates to do so because people take your jokes so seriously – one could very well say, without being completely wrong, that one sometimes learns much more by listening to a madman or a fool than by listening to a reasonable man. I am quite sure of it. There is nothing that withers you more than reasonable people.” <span class="Character-Style-1 _idGenCharOverride-1">27</span> June <span class="Character-Style-1 _idGenCharOverride-1">1961</span> (<span class="Character-Style-1 _idGenCharOverride-1">100</span>)</p>
