			<p class="body-text">“There are thieves in the <a id="_idIndexMarker795"></a>subtle world just as in the outer world. But you must close to them the doors of your thoughts and feelings as carefully as a prudent man bolts the doors of his house.</p>
			<p class="body-text">These suggestions of sadness, despair and suicide come from them (the thieves of the vital world), because it is when you are depressed that they are best able to rob you. You must not listen to them – you must reject the wicked suggestions and become yourself once again, that is to say, my “little smile”.” <br /><span class="Character-Style-1 _idGenCharOverride-1">9</span> January, <span class="Character-Style-1 _idGenCharOverride-1">1933</span> (<span class="Character-Style-1 _idGenCharOverride-1">74</span>)</p>
