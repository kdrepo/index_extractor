			<p class="body-text">“This idea of <a id="_idIndexMarker607"></a>renunciation can only arise in a self-centred consciousness. Naturally, people – the ones I call altogether primitive – are attached to things: when they have something, they do not want to let it go! It seems so childish to me!… When they have to part with something, it hurts! Because they identify themselves with the things they have. But this is childishness.” <span class="Character-Style-1 _idGenCharOverride-1">17</span> and <span class="Character-Style-1 _idGenCharOverride-1">24</span> August <span class="Character-Style-1 _idGenCharOverride-1">1963</span> (<span class="Character-Style-1 _idGenCharOverride-1">171</span>)</p>
