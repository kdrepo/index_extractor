			<p class="question-Style">“Mother, sometimes I see a queer thing. I see a region where dead flies go. Their condition seems to be a very miserable one. They complain that I kill so many flies.</p>
			<p class="body-text">These visions are imaginations which probably come from old thought-forms. There is no reason to sentimentalise about flies. They are beings created by the adverse forces and they must disappear from the earth.” <span class="Character-Style-1 _idGenCharOverride-1">14</span> October <span class="Character-Style-1 _idGenCharOverride-1">1955</span> (<span class="Character-Style-1 _idGenCharOverride-1">22</span>)</p>
