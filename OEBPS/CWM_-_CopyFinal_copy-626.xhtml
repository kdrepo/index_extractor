			<p class="body-text">“There is nothing that can truly be called <a id="_idIndexMarker801"></a>luck. What men call luck are the effects of causes they do not know.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Nor is there anything that in itself is good or bad luck; each one characterises circumstances as good or bad depending on whether they are more or less favourable to him; and this estimation itself is very superficial and ignorant, for one must already be a great sage to know what is truly favourable or unfavourable to oneself.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Moreover, the same event may be very good for one person and at the same time very bad for another. These estimations are purely subjective and depend on each one’s reaction to contacts coming from outside.” <span class="Character-Style-1 _idGenCharOverride-1">5</span> October, <span class="Character-Style-1 _idGenCharOverride-1">1959</span> (<span class="Character-Style-1 _idGenCharOverride-1">227</span>-<span class="Character-Style-1 _idGenCharOverride-1">28</span>)</p>
