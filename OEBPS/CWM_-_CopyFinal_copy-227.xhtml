			<p class="body-text">“...they presided over the creation of the material universe and the earth. And one of the proceedings was the formation of the <a id="_idIndexMarker423"></a>earth as a symbolic creation representative of the whole universe, in order to condense and concentrate the problem so that it might be solved more easily. And this earth, though it may be from the astronomical point of view something infinitesimal and as unimportant as can be, from the occult point of view of the universal creation it is a symbol which represents the universe so perfectly that by transforming the earth one can through contagion or analogy transform the universe, because the earth is the symbol of the universe. This was the procedure adopted by the gods. And the place that’s the seat of existence of these gods Sri Aurobindo has called the Overmind.” <span class="Character-Style-1 _idGenCharOverride-1">18</span> May <span class="Character-Style-1 _idGenCharOverride-1">1955</span> (<span class="Character-Style-1 _idGenCharOverride-1">161</span>-<span class="Character-Style-1 _idGenCharOverride-1">65</span>)</p>
