			<p class="body-text">“I can tell you one thing, that is, when I began with Sri Aurobindo to descend for the yoga, to descend from the mind into the vital, when we brought down our yoga from the mind into the vital, within one month – I was forty at that time, I didn’t look old, I looked younger than forty, but still I was forty – and after a month’s yoga I looked exactly eighteen. And someone who had seen me before, who had lived with me in Japan and came here, found it difficult to recognise me. He asked me, “But really, is it you?” I said, “Obviously!”</p>
			<p class="body-text">Only when we descended from the vital into the physical, then it was gone, for in the physical the work is much harder.” <span class="Character-Style-1 _idGenCharOverride-1">25</span> August <span class="Character-Style-1 _idGenCharOverride-1">1954</span> (<span class="Character-Style-1 _idGenCharOverride-1">303</span>)</p>
