			<p class="MotherAphorism">“1 – There are two allied powers in man: <a id="_idIndexMarker560"></a>knowledge and <a id="_idIndexMarker561"></a>Wisdom. Knowledge is so much of the truth, seen in a distorted medium, as the mind arrives at by groping; Wisdom what the eye of divine vision sees in the spirit. </p>
			<p class="body-text">Someone has asked me, “Why are the powers allied?” </p>
			<p class="body-text">I suppose that we are so used to seeing all the elements in man quarrelling among themselves that the idea of their being “allied” causes astonishment. But these quarrels are only apparent. All the powers which come from the higher regions are in fact necessarily allied – they are united, they have agreed to fight the Ignorance. And Sri Aurobindo says clearly enough – for those who understand – that one of these powers belongs to the mind and that the other belongs to the Spirit. This is precisely the profound truth that Sri Aurobindo wants to reveal in his aphorism: if the mind tries to obtain the second power, it is unable to do so, since it is a power that belongs to the Spirit and arises in the human being together with the spiritual consciousness.” <span class="Character-Style-1 _idGenCharOverride-1">12</span> September <span class="Character-Style-1 _idGenCharOverride-1">1958</span> (<span class="Character-Style-1 _idGenCharOverride-1">1</span>)</p>
