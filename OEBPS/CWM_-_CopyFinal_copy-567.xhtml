			<p class="body-text">“This evening the Divine Presence, concrete and material, was there present amongst you. I had a form of living gold, bigger than the universe, and I was facing a huge and massive golden door which separated the world from the Divine.</p>
			<p class="body-text">As I looked at the door, I knew and willed, in a single movement of consciousness, that “the time has come”, and lifting with both hands a mighty golden hammer I struck one blow, one single blow on the door and the door was shattered to pieces.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Then the supramental Light and Force and Consciousness rushed down upon earth in an uninterrupted flow.” <span class="Character-Style-1 _idGenCharOverride-1">29</span> February <span class="Character-Style-1 _idGenCharOverride-1">1956</span> (<span class="Character-Style-1 _idGenCharOverride-1">94</span>)</p>
