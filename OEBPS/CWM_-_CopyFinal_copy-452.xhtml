			<p class="body-text">“O our Mother, O Soul of India, Mother who hast never forsaken thy children even in the days of darkest depression, even when they turned away from thy voice, served other masters and denied thee, now when they have arisen and the light is on thy face in this dawn of thy liberation, in this great hour we salute thee. Guide us so that the horizon of freedom opening before us may be also a horizon of true greatness and of thy true life in the community of the nations. Guide us so that we may be always on the side of great ideals and show to men thy true visage, as a leader in the ways of the spirit and a friend and helper of all the peoples.” <span class="Character-Style-1 _idGenCharOverride-1">15</span> August <span class="Character-Style-1 _idGenCharOverride-1">1947</span> (<span class="Character-Style-1 _idGenCharOverride-1">352</span>)</p>
