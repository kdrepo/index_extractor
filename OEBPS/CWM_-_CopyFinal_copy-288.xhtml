			<p class="body-text">“...you must tell yourselves that the moment you begin to judge things, people, circumstances, you are in the most total human ignorance.</p>
			<p class="body-text">In short, one could put it like this: when one understands, one no longer judges and when one judges, it means that one doesn’t know.</p>
			<p class="body-text"><a id="_idIndexMarker513"></a>Judging people is one of the first things which must be totally swept away from the consciousness before you can take even a step on the supramental path, because that is not a material progress or a bodily progress, it is only a very little progress of thought, mental progress. And unless you have swept your mind clean of all its ignorance, you cannot hope to take a step on the supramental path.” <span class="Character-Style-1 _idGenCharOverride-1">26</span> June <span class="Character-Style-1 _idGenCharOverride-1">1957</span> (<span class="Character-Style-1 _idGenCharOverride-1">135</span>)</p>
