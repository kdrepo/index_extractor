			<p class="body-text">“There are pianists who have individualised their hands and made them so wonderfully <a id="_idIndexMarker489"></a>conscious that these hands are not decomposed – not the physical hands: the hands of the subtle physical and vital – they are not decomposed, do not dissolve at the time of death. They remain as instruments to play the piano and always try to incarnate in the hands of someone playing the piano. I have known some cases of people who, as they were about to play, felt as though other hands entered into theirs and started playing really marvellously, in a way they could not have done themselves.</p>
			<p class="body-text">These things are not as exceptional as one might believe, they happen quite often.</p>
			<p class="body-text">I saw the same thing in someone who used to play the violin and another who played the cello – two different cases – and who were not very wonderful performers themselves. One of them was just beginning his studies and the other was a good performer, but nothing marvellous. But all of a sudden, the moment they played the compositions of certain musicians, something of that musician entered into their hands and made their performance absolutely wonderful.</p>
			<p class="body-text">There was even a person – a woman – who used to play the cello, and the moment she played Beethoven, the expression of her face completely changed into Beethoven’s and what she played was sublime, which she could not have played unless something of Beethoven’s mind had entered into her.” <span class="Character-Style-1 _idGenCharOverride-1">3</span> October <span class="Character-Style-1 _idGenCharOverride-1">1956</span> (<span class="Character-Style-1 _idGenCharOverride-1">318</span>-<span class="Character-Style-1 _idGenCharOverride-1">19</span>)</p>
