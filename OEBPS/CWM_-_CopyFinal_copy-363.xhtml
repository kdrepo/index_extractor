			<p class="body-text">“For a long time quite recently, that is to say, for days together, there was a very acute, very intense, very clear perception that the action of the Force translated itself externally by what we call “<a id="_idIndexMarker630"></a>suffering” because that is the only kind of vibration which can pull Matter out of its inertia.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The supreme Peace, the supreme Calm are deformed and disfigured into inertia and into tamas, and precisely because this was the deformation of true Peace and Calm, there was no reason why it should change! A certain vibration of awakening – of reawakening – was necessary to come out of this tamas, that could not pass directly from tamas to Peace; something was needed to shake the tamas, and that is translated externally by suffering.</p>
			<p class="body-text">I am speaking here of physical suffering, because all the other sufferings – vital, mental, emotional sufferings – are due to a wrong working of the mind, and these… may simply be classed together as <a id="_idIndexMarker631"></a>Falsehood, that’s all. But physical suffering gives me the impression of a child being beaten, because here, in Matter, Falsehood has become ignorance; that is to say, there is no bad will – no bad will is there in Matter, all is inertia and ignorance: complete ignorance of the Truth, ignorance of the Origin, ignorance of the Possibility and ignorance even of what is to be done in order not to suffer physically. This ignorance is everywhere in the cells, and it is only the experience, the experience of what is translated in this rudimentary consciousness as suffering, which can awaken, bring forth the need to know and to cure, and the aspiration to transform oneself.” <span class="Character-Style-1 _idGenCharOverride-1">18</span> September <span class="Character-Style-1 _idGenCharOverride-1">1966</span> (<span class="Character-Style-1 _idGenCharOverride-1">41</span>)</p>
