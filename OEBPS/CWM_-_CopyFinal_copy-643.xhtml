			<p class="question-Style">“Gracious Mother,</p>
			<p class="question-Style">With your statement in the August Bulletin, I agree completely:</p>
			<p class="question-Style">“You cannot do yoga if you do not take it seriously. If you are not serious, you have an aspiration for five minutes and then for ten hours you do not have it; for one day you have a great urge and for a month you do not have it, and so on. You cannot do yoga under those conditions. If you forget and relax, you cannot do yoga.” </p>
			<p class="question-Style">But this is exactly what I do – I forget and relax! Yet you tell me repeatedly: “Don’t worry, it’s coming all right.” You say that the baby kitten way is the best – to take no responsibility for the sadhana – and that I should just live and work joyously (which I can’t do either). </p>
			<p class="question-Style">Mother, what attitude should I take when I read such things? </p>
			<p class="body-text">And what about the Divine Grace? Do you think it exists to remain idle? </p>
			<p class="body-text">Most have to work, but some are carried and are asked only to keep faith and confidence. </p>
			<p class="body-text">With love and blessings” <span class="Character-Style-1 _idGenCharOverride-1">1</span> September <span class="Character-Style-1 _idGenCharOverride-1">1966</span> (<span class="Character-Style-1 _idGenCharOverride-1">447</span>)</p>
