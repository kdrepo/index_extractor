			<p class="body-text">“Spiritual things... They are taught history or spiritual things, they are taught science or spiritual things. That is the stupidity.</p>
			<p class="body-text">In history, the Spirit is there; in science, the Spirit is there – the Truth is everywhere. And what is needed is not to teach it in a false way, but to teach it in a true way. They cannot get that into their heads.” <span class="Character-Style-1 _idGenCharOverride-1">5</span> April <span class="Character-Style-1 _idGenCharOverride-1">1967</span> (<span class="Character-Style-1 _idGenCharOverride-1">401</span>)</p>
