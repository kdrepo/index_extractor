			<h2 id="_idParaDest-191" class="SubHead1">A <a id="_idIndexMarker954"></a>Definition of Man</h2>
			<p class="body-text">“We confine ourselves in our consciousness to a single knot of the one indivisible Matter, a single eddy of the one indivisible Life, a single station of the one indivisible Mind, a single soul-manifestation of the one indivisible Spirit. Yet it is only by knowing the One that this individual mind, life, body, soul can know itself or its action. – Thus ignorance of self is the nature of our mind, but an ignorance full of the impulse towards self-possession and self-knowledge. A manysided Ignorance striving to become an all-embracing Knowledge is the definition of man the mental being.” (<span class="ref-num _idGenCharOverride-1">496</span>)</p>
