			<p class="Poetry">“You rose in India, O glorious in contemplation, O Sun,</p>
			<p class="Poetry">Illuminator of the vast ocean of life,</p>
			<p class="Poetry">Clarioning the new Path of an unstumbling progression.</p>
			<p class="Poetry">You have dug up the immense, sombre bedrock of the earth’s</p>
			<p class="Poetry">ignorance,</p>
			<p class="Poetry">And sought to unite in eternal marriage the devotion of the heart</p>
			<p class="Poetry">And the Force of life.</p>
			<p class="Poetry">We bow to you, Sri Aurobindo, O Sun of the New Age,</p>
			<p class="Poetry">Bringer of the New Light!</p>
			<p class="Poetry">May India, irradiated by your rays, become the Light-house of the </p>
			<p class="Poetry">world!</p>
			<p class="Poetry">To the country which, by losing its soul-mission, had lost the rhythm</p>
			<p class="Poetry">Of its life’s advance,</p>
			<p class="Poetry">And was darkened and blinded by the gloom of the ages,</p>
			<p class="Poetry">To point the inward way and reduce all obstacles to subservient aids,</p>
			<p class="Poetry">You have brought the message of the night’s end,</p>
			<p class="Poetry">O divine Ambidexter, wisdom-bright!</p>
			<p class="Poetry">We bow to you, Sri Aurobindo, O Sun of the New Age,</p>
			<p class="Poetry">Bringer of the New Light!</p>
			<p class="Poetry">May India, irradiated by your rays, become the Light-house of the</p>
			<p class="Poetry">world!</p>
			<p class="Poetry">The dust of your feet turned the prison into a temple,</p>
			<p class="Poetry">Your lofty ideal has lifted the nation’s life to a sublime aim,</p>
			<p class="Poetry">Your accomplishment has brought to our door</p>
			<p class="Poetry">the supreme treasure of Supermanhood,</p>
			<p class="Poetry">Your feet faltered not even when the heart of the world trembled.</p>
			<p class="Poetry">We bow to you, Sri Aurobindo, O Sun of the New Age,</p>
			<p class="Poetry">Bringer of the New Light!</p>
			<p class="Poetry">May India, irradiated by your rays, become the Light-house of the </p>
			<p class="Poetry">world! </p>
