			<p class="body-text">“<a id="_idIndexMarker544"></a><span class="Index-Entry">Aishwarya</span> in effect is of three kinds, that which creates a tendency or produces an effect, but does not eventually or at all succeed; <span class="ref-num _idGenCharOverride-1">2</span>, that which produces the final effect, but slowly, with difficulty, against an effective resistance; <span class="ref-num _idGenCharOverride-1">3</span>, that which produces the final effect not as a combatant, but victoriously as a master. The first has to be eliminated from the siddhi henceforth; the second to be preserved for a time, the third to be continually strengthened until it replaces all the others.” (<span class="ref-num _idGenCharOverride-1">208</span>)</p>
