			<h2 id="_idParaDest-357" class="SubHead1">The Present Condition of the <a id="_idIndexMarker1326"></a>Human Race</h2>
			<p class="body-text">“... the human race is still weighted by a certain <a id="_idIndexMarker1327"></a>gravitation towards the physical, it obeys still the pull of our yet unconquered earth-matter; it is dominated by the brain-mind, the physical intelligence: thus held back by many ties, it hesitates before the indication or falls back before the too tense demand of the spiritual effort. It has, too, still a great capacity for sceptical folly, an immense indolence, an enormous intellectual and spiritual timidity and conservatism when called out of the grooves of habit: even the constant evidence of life itself that where it chooses to conquer it can conquer, – witness the miracles of that quite inferior power, <a id="_idIndexMarker1328"></a>physical Science, – does not prevent it from doubting; it repels the new call and leaves the response to a few individuals. But that is not enough if the step forward is to be for humanity; for it is only if the race advances that, for it, the victories of the Spirit can be secure.” (<span class="ref-num _idGenCharOverride-1">752</span>)</p>
