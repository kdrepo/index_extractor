			<p class="body-text">“There is no incompatibility between the Eternal and existence in Time. <a id="_idIndexMarker842"></a>Time and the Timeless are the same Eternity in a self-contained status and a self-developing movement. The Timeless is eternal and knows itself in an everlasting present; Time too is eternal and is known in an indivisible movement of past, present and future. It is our consciousness poising itself in the mobile moment that gives us the impression of a divided Time, of consciousness moving from moment to moment, losing its past, gaining its future, connecting the three only by an act of memory which binds the is to the was and the to be. In the eternal Consciousness the past still exists and extends through the present into the future.” (<span class="ref-num _idGenCharOverride-1">184</span>)</p>
