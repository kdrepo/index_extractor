			<h2 id="_idParaDest-251" class="SubHead1">The Gita Written in Plain Terms</h2>
			<p class="body-text">“There is a method of explaining the Gita in which not only this episode but the whole <a id="_idIndexMarker1131"></a><span class="Index-Entry">Mahabharata</span> is turned into an <a id="_idIndexMarker1132"></a><span class="Index-Entry">allegory</span> of the inner life and has nothing to do with our outward human life and action, but only with the battles of the soul and the powers that strive within us for possession. That is a view which the general character and the actual language of the epic does not justify and, if pressed, would turn the straightforward philosophical language of the Gita into a constant, laborious and somewhat puerile mystification. The language of the Veda and part at least of the Puranas is plainly symbolic, full of figures and concrete representations of things that lie behind the veil, but the Gita is written in plain terms and professes to solve the great ethical and spiritual difficulties which the life of man raises, and it will not do to go behind this plain language and thought and wrest them to the service of our fancy.” (<span class="ref-num _idGenCharOverride-1">20</span>-<span class="ref-num _idGenCharOverride-1">21</span>)</p>
