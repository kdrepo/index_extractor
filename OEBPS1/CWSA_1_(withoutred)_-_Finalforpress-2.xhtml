			<p class="body-text">“Duty is a phantasm spawned in the green morass of human weakness &amp; ignorance, but perpetuated by vague thought and vaguer sentiment. And so long as we are imperatively told to do our duty, without knowing why we should do it, the vagueness of private judgment, the cruelty of social coercion will be the sole arbiters and the saint will be a worse enemy of virtue than the sinner.” (<span class="ref-num _idGenCharOverride-1">18</span>)</p>
			<p class="body-text">“I will not talk of duty: it is a word I do not like, for it is always used in antagonism to pleasure, and brings back the noisome savour of the days when to do what I was told, was held out as my highest legitimate aspiration. I will use instead the word virtue, whose inherent meaning is <a id="_idIndexMarker004"></a><span class="Index-Entry">manliness</span>, in other words, the perfect evolution by the human being of the inborn qualities and powers native to his humanity.” (<span class="ref-num _idGenCharOverride-1">19</span>)</p>
