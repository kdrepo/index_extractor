			<p class="body-text">Vainly lie Space and Time, “Void are we, there is none.”</p>
			<p class="body-text">Vainly strive Self and World crying “I, I alone.”</p>
			<p class="body-text">One is there, Self of self, Soul of Space, Fount of Time,</p>
			<p class="body-text">Heart of hearts, Mind of minds, He alone sits, sublime.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Oh no void Absolute self-absorbed, splendid, mute,</p>
			<p class="body-text">Hands that clasp hold and red lips that kiss blow His flute.</p>
			<p class="body-text">All He loves, all He moves, all are His, all are He;</p>
			<p class="body-text">Many limbs sate His whims, bear His sweet ecstasy.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Two in One, Two who know difference rich in sense,</p>
			<p class="body-text">Two to clasp, One to be, this His strange mystery. (<span class="ref-num _idGenCharOverride-1">637</span>)</p>
