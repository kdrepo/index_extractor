			<p class="body-text">“Whether we follow exclusively after Avidya or exclusively after Vidya, we go equally astray, exclusiveness means ignorance, exclusiveness means confusion &amp; division of the indivisible Brahman, &amp; persistence in such error is an obstinacy fatal to the soul in its immediate prospects. Temporarily – because eternal perdition is impossible, – it fails to cross successfully over death &amp; enters into trans-mortal darkness. Those who accept the unity of the Brahman, who see in Vidya &amp; Avidya only vyavahara, light &amp; shadow reflected in Him for the use of self-expression in phenomena, who live in the knowledge of the One in the Many, embracing like Brahman all being in themselves, rejecting nothing, preferring nothing, bearing everything, effecting everything, infinite in calm by renunciation, infinite in might &amp; bliss by enjoyment, they are men perfected, they are the siddhas. Even those who not yet attaining, follow faithfully this law &amp; this ideal journey onwards in the way of their self-fulfilment and are lifted by all-purifying Agni to the regions of the Sun where they possess their perfect oneness &amp; receive their consummate felicity....” (<span class="ref-num _idGenCharOverride-1">387</span>)</p>
