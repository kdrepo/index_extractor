			<p class="body-text">“Maya meant for them the power of infinite consciousness to comprehend, contain in itself and measure out, that is to say, to form – for form is delimitation – Name and Shape out of the vast illimitable Truth of infinite existence. It is by Maya that static truth of essential being becomes ordered truth of active being – or, to put it in more metaphysical language, out of the supreme being in which all is all without barrier of separative consciousness emerges the phenomenal being in which all is in each and each is in all for the play of existence with existence, consciousness with consciousness, force with force, delight with delight.” (<span class="ref-num _idGenCharOverride-1">123</span>-<span class="ref-num _idGenCharOverride-1">24</span>)</p>
