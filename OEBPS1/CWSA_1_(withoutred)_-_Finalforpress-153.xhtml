			<p class="body-text">“<a id="_idIndexMarker836"></a><span class="Index-Entry">Evolution</span> in its essence is not the development of a more and more organised body or a more and more efficient life – these are only its machinery and outward circumstance. Evolution is the strife of a Consciousness somnambulised in Matter to wake and be free and find and possess itself and all its possibilities to the very utmost and widest, to the very last and highest. Evolution is the emancipation of a self-revealing Soul secret in Form and Force, the slow becoming of a Godhead, the growth of a Spirit.</p>
			<p class="body-text">In this evolution mental man is not the goal and end, the completing value, the highest last significance; he is too small and imperfect to be the crown of all this travail of Nature. <a id="_idIndexMarker837"></a><span class="Index-Entry">Man</span> is not final, but a middle term only, a transitional being, an instrumental intermediate creature.” (<span class="ref-num _idGenCharOverride-1">166</span>)</p>
