			<p class="body-text">“For the last two or three days the siddhi of <a id="_idIndexMarker553"></a>self-preservation &amp; <a id="_idIndexMarker554"></a><span class="Index-Entry">whiteness in the teeth</span> has been swiftly recovering its force. For some months past the asiddhi had returned and the yellow film returned and deepened; now the lower teeth are again white with only a faint suggestion of the yellow shade. In the upper teeth the film is there in blotches, not covering the whole surface, but is rapidly dissolving. N.B. It is now more than four years since any artificial means of preservation or cleansing (brush, powder etc) were last used. In other respects, there are some faint signs of advance in <a id="_idIndexMarker555"></a><span class="Index-Entry">saundarya</span>, but none of these are decisive.” (<span class="ref-num _idGenCharOverride-1">276</span>)</p>
