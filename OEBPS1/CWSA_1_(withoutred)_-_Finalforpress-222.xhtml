			<p class="body-text">“The totality of Vedantic knowledge consists of several processes; first, <a id="_idIndexMarker1095"></a><span class="Index-Entry">Vedanta</span>, the direct perception of the fundamental reality out of which all emerges &amp; to which all returns; secondly, <a id="_idIndexMarker1096"></a><span class="Index-Entry">Sankhya</span>, the analysis, by the discriminating perception, of the fundamental principles of being &amp; knowledge in which the Reality manifests itself as world, as subject, &amp; as object; thirdly, <a id="_idIndexMarker1097"></a><span class="Index-Entry">Yoga</span>, the psychological basis of experience, experiment, practical analysis, synthesis which verifies the discriminative analysis; fourthly, <a id="_idIndexMarker1098"></a><span class="Index-Entry">Vaisheshika</span>, the physical analysis of the form or matter in which the manifesting world-energy is expressed &amp; established to our outgoing perceptions; fifthly, <a id="_idIndexMarker1099"></a><span class="Index-Entry">Nyaya</span>, the analysis of the processes of discrimination whether by the intellect or by higher functions; sixthly, <a id="_idIndexMarker1100"></a><span class="Index-Entry">Karma</span> of Veda, the application of the knowledge acquired in formulas of life-action by which the individual &amp; the community can ensure the highest phenomenal expression of the fundamental Reality of which their special nature is capable, – by which, let us say, man can express Brahman in his superior &amp; more plastic kind as the bee or the ant expresses Brahman in its inferior &amp; more rigid &amp; limited nature; – these six rank among other processes, – for life of Veda is supple, flexible and wide, – some of which are the foundation of <a id="_idIndexMarker1101"></a><span class="Index-Entry">Purana</span> &amp; <a id="_idIndexMarker1102"></a><span class="Index-Entry">Itihasa</span>. The fundamental perception, separating, narrowed itself and became the Uttara Mimansa of Badarayana; the discriminative analysis, separating, narrowed itself and became Sankhya of Kapila; the psychological experimentation, separating, narrowed itself &amp; became Yoga of Patanjali; the physical analysis, separating, narrowed itself and became Vaisheshika of Kanada; the analysis of discriminative processes, separating, narrowed itself and became Nyaya of Gautama; the application in formulas of life-action, separating, narrowed itself extremely &amp; became the Purva Mimansa of Jaimini; yet each of the six arrogated to itself the functions &amp; the sufficiency of the other five. Other parts of knowledge &amp; process, ejected by the ever-narrowing tendency of logical exclusiveness, established themselves in other philosophies and branches of practice &amp; knowledge and have come down to us, changed, often disfigured, in Shastra, in Purana, in legend &amp; history, in different schools of Yoga.” (<span class="ref-num _idGenCharOverride-1">570</span>-<span class="ref-num _idGenCharOverride-1">71</span>)</p>
