			<p class="body-text">“Vedanta’s final &amp; single answer to all the questions of philosophy is contained in a single mighty &amp; ever-memorable phrase, So’ham. I am He or more explicitly or to the question of the inquirer  अहं ब्रह्मास्मि, I am Brahman. Cutting through all tremors &amp; hesitations, scorning all doubt or reserve it announces with a hardy &amp; daring incisiveness the complete identity of man &amp; God. This is its gospel that the individual Self who seems so limited, thwarted, befouled, shamed &amp; obscured with the bonds &amp; shackles, the mud &amp; stains of earthly life and the pure, perfect and illimitable Being who possesses &amp; supports all existence, to Whom this vast and majestic Universe is but an inconsiderable corner of His mind and infinite Time cannot end and infinite Space cannot confine and the infinite net of cause and effect is powerless to trammel are equal, are of one nature, power, splendour, bliss, are One. It seems the very madness of megalomania, the very delirium of egoism. And yet if it be true?</p>
			<p class="body-text">And it is true. Reason can come to no other conclusion, Yoga ends in no less an experience, the voices of a hundred holy witnesses who have seen God face to face, bring to us no less wonderful a message.” (<span class="ref-num _idGenCharOverride-1">337</span>)</p>
