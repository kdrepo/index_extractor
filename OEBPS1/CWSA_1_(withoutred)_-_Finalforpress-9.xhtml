			<p class="body-text">“The vital law governing <a id="_idIndexMarker031"></a><span class="Index-Entry">Hindu poetics</span> is that it does not seek to represent life and character primarily or for their own sake; its aim is fundamentally aesthetic, by the delicate &amp; harmonious rendering of passion to awaken the aesthetic sense of the onlooker and gratify it by moving or subtly observed pictures of human feeling; it did not attempt to seize a man’s spirit by the hair and drag it out into a storm of horror &amp; pity &amp; fear and return it to him drenched, beaten and shuddering. To the Hindu it would have seemed a savage and inhuman spirit that could take any aesthetic pleasure in the sufferings of an Oedipus or a Duchess of Malfi or in the tragedy of a Macbeth or an Othello. Partly this arose from the divine tenderness of the <a id="_idIndexMarker032"></a><span class="Index-Entry">Hindu nature</span>, always noble, forbearing &amp; gentle and at that time saturated with the sweet &amp; gracious pity &amp; purity which flowed from the soul of <a id="_idIndexMarker033"></a><span class="Index-Entry">Buddha</span>; but it was also a necessary result of the principle that aesthetic &amp; intellectual pleasure is the first object of all poetic art. Certainly poetry was regarded as a force for elevation as well as for charm, but as it reaches these objects through aesthetic beauty, aesthetic gratification must be the whole basis of dramatic composition; all other objects are superstructural. The Hindu mind therefore shrank not only from violence, horror &amp; physical tragedy, the Elizabethan stock-in-trade, but even from the tragic moral problems which attracted the Greek mind; still less could it have consented to occupy itself with the problems of disease, neurosis and spiritual medicology generally which are the staple of modern drama and fiction. An atmosphere of romantic beauty, a high urbanity and a gracious equipoise of the feelings, a perpetual confidence in the sunshine &amp; the flowers, are the essential spirit of a Hindu play; pity and terror are used to awaken the feelings, but not to lacerate them, and the drama must close on the note of joy and peace; the clouds are only admitted to make more beautiful the glad sunlight from which all came &amp; into which all must melt away. It is in an art like this that the soul finds the repose, the opportunity for being, confirmed in gentleness and in kindly culture, the unmixed intellectual and aesthetic pleasure in quest of which it has turned away from the crudeness &amp; incoherence of life to the magic regions of Art.</p>
			<p class="body-text">When therefore <a id="_idIndexMarker034"></a><span class="Index-Entry">English scholars</span>, fed on the exceedingly strong &amp; often raw meat of the Elizabethans, assert that there are no characters in the Hindu drama, when they attribute this deficiency to the feebleness of inventive power which leads “Asiatic” poetry to concentrate itself on glowing description and imagery, seeking by excess of ornament to conceal poverty of substance, when even their Indian pupils perverted from good taste and blinded to fine discrimination by a love of the striking &amp; a habit of gross forms &amp; pronounced colours due to the too exclusive study of English poetry, repeat &amp; reenforce their criticisms, the lover of <a id="_idIndexMarker035"></a><span class="Index-Entry">Kalidasa</span> &amp; his peers need not be alarmed; he need not banish from his imagination the gracious company with which it is peopled as a gilded &amp; soulless list of names. For these dicta spring from prejudice and the echo of a prejudice; they are evidence not of a more vigorous critical mind but of a restricted critical sympathy. Certainly if we expect a Beautiful White Devil or a Jew of Malta from the Hindu dramatist, we shall be disappointed; he deals not in these splendid or horrible masks. If we come to him for a Lear or a Macbeth, we shall go away discontented; for these also are sublimities which belong to cruder civilisations and more barbarous national types; in worst crimes &amp; deepest suffering as well as in happiness &amp; virtue, the <a id="_idIndexMarker036"></a><span class="Index-Entry">Aryan</span> was more civilized &amp; temperate, less crudely enormous than the hard, earthy &amp; material African peoples whom in Europe he only half moralised. If he seeks a Père Goriot or a Madame Bovary, he will still fail in his quest; for though such types doubtless existed at all times among the mass of the people with its large strain of African blood, <a id="_idIndexMarker037"></a><span class="Index-Entry">Hindu Art</span> would have shrunk from poisoning the moral atmosphere of the soul by elaborate studies of depravity. The true spirit of criticism is to seek in a literature what we can find in it of great or beautiful, not to demand from it what it does not seek to give us.” (<span class="ref-num _idGenCharOverride-1">191</span>-<span class="ref-num _idGenCharOverride-1">93</span>)</p>
