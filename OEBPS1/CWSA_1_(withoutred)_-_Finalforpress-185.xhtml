			<p class="body-text">“In the progressive enlargement of his knowledge he gets rid of his sevenfold ignorance; of the temporal by growing into his eternal being with its pre-existence and subsequent existence in Time; of the psychological by enlarging his self-knowing beyond the waking self into the subconscient and superconscient; of the constitutional by realising his spiritual being and its categories; of the cosmic by discovering his timeless self; of the egoistic by realising the cosmic consciousness; of the original by opening to the Absolute of whom Self, individual and Nature are so many faces. – At the same time he realises the unity of himself and Nature in the first three steps of knowledge, of himself and God in the others; of himself with all beings relatively in Nature and absolutely in God; of God and Nature because it is the Self who has become all these beings and the nature of the Lord which is apparent in cosmos.” (<span class="ref-num _idGenCharOverride-1">499</span>-<span class="ref-num _idGenCharOverride-1">500</span>)</p>
