			<p class="body-text">“<a id="_idIndexMarker933"></a><span class="Index-Entry">Death</span> is the question Nature puts continually to Life and her reminder to it that it has not yet found itself. If there were no siege of death, the creature would be bound for ever in the form of an imperfect living. Pursued by death he awakes to the idea of perfect life and seeks out its means and its possibility.” (<span class="ref-num _idGenCharOverride-1">205</span>)</p>
			<p class="body-text">“<a id="_idIndexMarker934"></a><span class="Index-Entry">Pain</span> and grief are Nature’s reminder to the soul that the pleasure it enjoys is only a feeble hint of the real delight of existence. In each pain and torture of our being is the secret of a flame of rapture compared with which our greatest pleasures are only as dim flickerings. It is this secret which forms the attraction for the soul of the great ordeals, sufferings and fierce experiences of life which the nervous mind in us shuns and abhors.”(<span class="ref-num _idGenCharOverride-1">205</span>)</p>
