			<p class="body-text">“India has in herself a faith of superhuman virtue to accomplish miracles, to deliver herself out of irrefragable bondage, to bring God down upon earth. She has a secret of will power which no other nation possesses. All she needs to rouse in her that faith, that will, is an ideal which will induce her to make the effort…. The ideal is that of humanity in God, of God in humanity, the ancient ideal of the <a id="_idIndexMarker353"></a>sanatana dharma but applied as it has never been applied before to the problem of politics and the work of national revival. To realise that ideal, to impart it to the world is the <a id="_idIndexMarker354"></a><span class="Index-Entry">mission of India</span>. She has evolved a religion which embraces all that the heart, the brain, the practical faculty of man can desire but she has not yet applied it to the problems of modern politics. This therefore is the work which she has still to do before she can help humanity; the necessity of this mission is the justification for her resurgence, the great incentive of saving herself to save mankind is the native power which will give her the force, the strength, the vehemence which can alone enable her to realise her destiny.” (<span class="ref-num _idGenCharOverride-1">7</span> : <span class="ref-num _idGenCharOverride-1">1017</span>)</p>
