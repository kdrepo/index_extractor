			<p class="body-text">“The <a id="_idIndexMarker253"></a><span class="Index-Entry">Satya</span> is full of <a id="_idIndexMarker254"></a><span class="Index-Entry">Srikrishna</span>; it is the golden Age when men are full of might and wisdom. The Treta is full of <a id="_idIndexMarker255"></a><span class="Index-Entry">Balarama</span>; the <a id="_idIndexMarker256"></a><span class="Index-Entry">Chakravarti Raja</span> is the incarnation of the Treta; it is full of great wars and mighty sacrifices. The Dwapara is full of Pradyumna; He prepares in the <a id="_idIndexMarker257"></a><span class="Index-Entry">Dwapara</span> the love which supports men through the <a id="_idIndexMarker258"></a><span class="Index-Entry">Kali</span>. <a id="_idIndexMarker259"></a><span class="Index-Entry">Aniruddha</span>, the <a id="_idIndexMarker260"></a><span class="Index-Entry">Sudra</span>, reigns in the Kali; He breaks the ancient moulds, He shatters to pieces the <a id="_idIndexMarker261"></a><span class="Index-Entry">achar</span>; He questions everything, destroys everything, levels everything, rebuilds everything. He is a Sudra and has the passion for work and service; He puts off lordship in order to become the divine Slave of humanity.</p>
			<p class="body-text">For each of Them is not simple in Himself, but contains the other three and their attributes; only His own are usually foremost. Each is not a part but God Himself in His fullness. They are not different, but the same, Four who are One, One who is Four. That one is Srikrishna.” (<span class="ref-num _idGenCharOverride-1">533</span>)</p>
