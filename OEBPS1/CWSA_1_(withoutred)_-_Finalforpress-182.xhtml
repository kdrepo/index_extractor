			<h2 id="_idParaDest-190" class="SubHead1">Stages in the Emotional Expansion of the Egoistic Consciousness</h2>
			<p class="body-text">“The <a id="_idIndexMarker951"></a><span class="Index-Entry">egoistic consciousness</span> passes through many stages in its emotional expansion. At first it is bound within itself, callous therefore to the experiences of others. Afterwards it is sympathetic only with those who are identified in some measure with itself, indifferent to the indifferent, malignant to the hostile. When it overcomes this respect for persons, it is ready for the reception of the altruistic principle.</p>
			<p class="body-text">But even <a id="_idIndexMarker952"></a><span class="Index-Entry">charity</span> and <a id="_idIndexMarker953"></a><span class="Index-Entry">altruism</span> are often essentially egoistic in their immediate motive. They are stirred by the discomfort of the sight of suffering to the nervous system or by the pleasurableness of others’ appreciation of our kindliness or by the egoistic self-appreciation of our own benevolence or by the need of indulgence in sympathy. There are philanthropists who would be troubled if the poor were not always with us, for they would then have no field for their charity.” (<span class="ref-num _idGenCharOverride-1">454</span>)</p>
