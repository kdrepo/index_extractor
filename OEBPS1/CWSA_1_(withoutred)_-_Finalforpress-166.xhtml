			<h2 id="_idParaDest-173" class="SubHead1">The Ineffectivity of <a id="_idIndexMarker860"></a>Mental Ideals</h2>
			<p class="body-text">“The ideals created by the mind are constructions in the air that have no sufficient foundation in our vital and physical nature; therefore they can change a side of our mind and colour a part of our actions, but they cannot transform our lives, cannot find here their physical body. Ideals touch and pass, mankind remains the same; after religions, ideals, moralities without end we keep always the same ignorant and imperfect human nature.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Moral rules and ideals are a harness for the ignorant soul, bridle and bit for the passions, reins that compel it to an assigned road, yoke and poles and traces that bind it to be faithful to the burden it carries. Morality checks and controls but does not purify or change the vital nature.</p>
			<p class="body-text">In <a id="_idIndexMarker861"></a>ethics there is an artificial shaping of the mind’s surfaces, but no spiritual freedom, no satisfying perfection of the whole dynamic nature.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The mind’s ideals like the life’s seekings are at once absolute each in its own demand and in conflict with one another; neither mind nor life knows the means either of their complete or their harmonised fulfilment. The mind labours through the centuries but human nature remains faithful to its imperfections and man’s life amid its changes always the same.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Beyond mind on spiritual and supramental levels dwells the Presence, the Truth, the Power, the Bliss that can alone deliver us from these illusions, display the Light of which our ideals are tarnished disguises and impose the harmony that shall at once transfigure and reconcile all the parts of our nature.” (<span class="ref-num _idGenCharOverride-1">350</span>)</p>
