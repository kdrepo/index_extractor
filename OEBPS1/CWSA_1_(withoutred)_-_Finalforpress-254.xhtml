			<p class="body-text">“This then is the integral truth, the highest and widest knowledge. The Divine is supracosmic, the eternal <a id="_idIndexMarker1154"></a><span class="Index-Entry">Parabrahman</span> who supports with his timeless and spaceless existence all this cosmic manifestation of his own being and nature in Space and Time. He is the supreme spirit who ensouls the forms and movements of the universe, <a id="_idIndexMarker1155"></a><span class="Index-Entry">Paramatman</span>. He is the supernal Person of whom all self and nature, all being and becoming in this or any universe are the self-conception and the self-energising, <a id="_idIndexMarker1156"></a><span class="Index-Entry">Purushottama</span>. He is the ineffable Lord of all existence who by his spiritual control of his own manifested Power in Nature unrolls the cycles of the world and the natural evolution of creatures in the cycles, <a id="_idIndexMarker1157"></a><span class="Index-Entry">Parameshwara</span>. From him the Jiva, individual spirit, soul in Nature, existent by his being, conscious by the light of his consciousness, empowered to knowledge, to will and to action by his will and power, enjoying existence by his divine enjoyment of the cosmos, has come here into the cosmic rounds.” (<span class="ref-num _idGenCharOverride-1">322</span>)</p>
