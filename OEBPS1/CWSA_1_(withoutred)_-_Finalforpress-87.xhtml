			<p class="body-text">“British education has denationalised the educated community, laid waste the fertile soil of the Indian intellect, suppressed originality and invention, created a gulf between the classes and the masses and done its best to kill that spirituality which is the soul of India. The petty privileges which British statecraft has thrown to us as morsels from the rich repast of liberty, have pauperised us politically, preserved all that was low, weak and dependent in our political temperament and discouraged the old robust manhood of our forefathers.” <br />(<span class="ref-num _idGenCharOverride-1">7</span> : <span class="ref-num _idGenCharOverride-1">969</span>-<span class="ref-num _idGenCharOverride-1">70</span>)</p>
