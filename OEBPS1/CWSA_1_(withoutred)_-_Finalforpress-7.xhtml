			<h2 id="_idParaDest-8" class="SubHead1">The Essence of the <a id="_idIndexMarker020"></a><span class="Index-Entry">History of Ancient India</span></h2>
			<p class="body-text">“<a id="_idIndexMarker021"></a><span class="Index-Entry">Valmiki</span>, <a id="_idIndexMarker022"></a><span class="Index-Entry">Vyasa</span> and <a id="_idIndexMarker023"></a><span class="Index-Entry">Kalidasa</span> are the essence of the history of ancient India; if all else were lost, they would still be its sole and sufficient cultural history. Their poems are types and exponents of three periods in the development of the human soul, types and exponents also of the three great powers which dispute and clash in the imperfect and half-formed temperament and harmonise in the formed and perfect. At the same time their works are pictures at once minute and grandiose of three moods of our Aryan civilisation, of which the first was predominatingly moral, the second predominatingly intellectual, the third predominatingly material. The fourth power of the soul, the spiritual, which can alone govern and harmonise the others by fusion with them, had not, though it pervaded and powerfully influenced each successive development, any separate age of predominance, did not like the others possess the whole race with a dominating obsession. It is because, conjoining in themselves the highest and most varied poetical gifts, they at the same time represent and mirror their age and humanity by their interpretative largeness and power that our three chief poets hold their supreme place and bear comparison with the greatest world-names, with <a id="_idIndexMarker024"></a><span class="Index-Entry">Homer</span>, <a id="_idIndexMarker025"></a><span class="Index-Entry">Shakespeare</span> and <a id="_idIndexMarker026"></a><span class="Index-Entry">Dante</span>.” (<span class="ref-num _idGenCharOverride-1">156</span>)</p>
