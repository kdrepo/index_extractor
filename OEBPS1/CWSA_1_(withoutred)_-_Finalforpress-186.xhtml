			<h2 id="_idParaDest-194" class="SubHead1">The <a id="_idIndexMarker958"></a>Problems of Existence are Problems of Harmony</h2>
			<p class="body-text">“The accordance of an active life-principle with the inanimate Matter containing it is Nature’s first evolutionary problem; its complete solution would be immortality in the body.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The accordance of conscious mind with an unconscious matter and half-conscious life is her second evolutionary problem; a direct and perfect instrumentation of knowledge in a living body would be its complete solution.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The accordance of immortal spirit with a mortal mind, life and body is her third and final problem; its complete solution would be the evolution of a divine being and a divine nature.</p>
			<p class="body-text">As Nature has implanted the impulse to life in matter, to mind in life, so she has implanted in mind the impulse towards the evolution of what is beyond mind, spiritual, supramental. Each impulse justifies itself by the creation of the necessary organs and faculties.</p>
			<p class="body-text">The animal is a laboratory in which she has worked out man; man may be a laboratory in which she wills to work out the superman, the being of a divine nature.” (<span class="ref-num _idGenCharOverride-1">503</span>)</p>
