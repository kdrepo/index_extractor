			<p class="body-text"><a id="_idTextAnchor061"></a>Ashwamedha: “The Horse-sacrifice is the offering of the Life-power with all its impulses, desires, enjoyments to the divine existence. The Life-soul (Dwita) is itself the giver of this sacrifice which it performs when by the power of Agni it attains to vision on its own vital plane, when it becomes, in the figure of the hymn, the illumined seer Ashwamedha.” (<span class="ref-num _idGenCharOverride-1">468</span>)</p>
			<p class="body-text"><a id="_idTextAnchor062"></a>Soma: “The delight extracted from existence is typified by the honey wine of the Soma; it is mixed with the milk, the curds and the grain, the milk being that of the luminous cows, the curds the fixation of their yield in the intellectual mind and the grain the formulation of the light in the force of the physical mind. These symbolic senses are indicated by the double meaning of the words used, go, dadhi and yava.” (<span class="ref-num _idGenCharOverride-1">468</span>)</p>
