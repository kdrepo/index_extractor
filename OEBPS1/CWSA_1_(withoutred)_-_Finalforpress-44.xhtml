Mr. Tilak’s name stands already for history as a nation-builder, one of the half-dozen greatest political personalities, memorable figures, representative men of the nation in this most critical period of India’s destinies, a name to be remembered gratefully so long as the country has pride in its past and hope for its future.” (<span class="ref-num _idGenCharOverride-1">656</span>-<span class="ref-num _idGenCharOverride-1">57</span>)</p>
