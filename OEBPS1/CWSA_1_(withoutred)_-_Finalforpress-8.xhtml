			<p class="body-text">“It has been said, truly, that the Ramayana represents an ideal society and assumed, illogically, that it must therefore represent an altogether imaginary one. The argument ignores the alternative of a real society idealised. No poet could evolve entirely out of his own imagination a picture at once so colossal, so minute and so consistent in every detail. No number of poets could do it without stumbling into fatal incompatibilities either of fact or of view, such as we find defacing the Mahabharata. This is not the place to discuss the question of Valmiki’s age and authorship. This much, however, may be said that after excluding the <a id="_idIndexMarker029"></a><span class="Index-Entry">Uttarakanda</span>, which is a later work, and some amount of interpolation, for the most part easy enough to detect, and reforming the text which is not unfrequently in a state of truly shocking confusion, the Ramayana remains on the face of it the work of a single mighty and embracing mind.” (<span class="ref-num _idGenCharOverride-1">156</span>-<span class="ref-num _idGenCharOverride-1">57</span>)</p>
