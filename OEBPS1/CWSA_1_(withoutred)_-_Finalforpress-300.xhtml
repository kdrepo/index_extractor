			<p class="body-text">“...it is well that we should recognise the enormous, the indispensable utility of the very brief period of rationalistic <a id="_idIndexMarker1266"></a><span class="Index-Entry">Materialism</span> through which humanity has been passing. For that vast field of evidence and experience which now begins to reopen its gates to us, can only be safely entered when the intellect has been severely trained to a clear austerity; seized on by unripe minds, it lends itself to the most perilous distortions and misleading imaginations and actually in the past encrusted a real nucleus of truth with such an accretion of perverting superstitions and irrationalising dogmas that all advance in true knowledge was rendered impossible. It became necessary for a time to make a clean sweep at once of the truth and its disguise in order that the road might be clear for a new departure and a surer advance. The rationalistic tendency of Materialism has done mankind this great service.” (<span class="ref-num _idGenCharOverride-1">12</span>-<span class="ref-num _idGenCharOverride-1">13</span>)</p>
