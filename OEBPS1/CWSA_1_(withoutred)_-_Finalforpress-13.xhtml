			<p class="body-text">“What was the secret of that gigantic intellectuality, spirituality and superhuman moral force which we see pulsating in the <a id="_idIndexMarker058"></a><span class="Index-Entry">Ramayana</span> and <a id="_idIndexMarker059"></a><span class="Index-Entry">Mahabharata</span>, in the ancient philosophy, in the supreme poetry, art, sculpture and architecture of India? What was at the basis of the incomparable public works and engineering achievements, the opulent and exquisite industries, the great triumphs of science, scholarship, jurisprudence, logic, metaphysics, the unique social structure? What supported the heroism and self-abandonment of the Kshatriya, the Sikh and the Rajput, the unconquerable national vitality and endurance? What was it that stood behind that civilisation second to none in the massiveness of its outlines or the perfection of its details? Without a great and unique discipline involving a perfect education of soul and mind, a result so immense and persistent would have been impossible. It would be an error to look for the secret of Aryan success in the details of the instruction given in the old ashrams and universities so far as they have come down to us. We must know what was the principle and basis on which the details were founded. We shall find the secret of their success in a profound knowledge of human psychology and its subtle application to the methods of intellectual training and instruction.” (<span class="ref-num _idGenCharOverride-1">369</span>)</p>
