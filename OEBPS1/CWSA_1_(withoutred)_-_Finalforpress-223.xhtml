			<p class="body-text">“We can know God, we can become the Brahman.</p>
			<p class="body-text">This promise long confined to the few, to the initiates in India, is once more being placed before the whole world for its acceptance. Of this supreme offer a life recently lived in an obscure corner of the earth seems to me to be the very incarnation &amp; illuminating symbol, – the life of the Paramhansa <a id="_idIndexMarker1103"></a><span class="Index-Entry">Ramakrishna</span> of Dakshineswar. Not for any body of teachings that he left behind, not for any restricted type of living, peculiar system of ethics or religious panacea for the ills of existence, – but because it brought once more into the world with an unexampled thoroughness &amp; liberality the great Vedantic method of experience &amp; inner revelation &amp; showed us its possibilities. An illiterate, poor &amp; obscure Bengali peasant, one who to the end of his life used a patois full of the most rustic forms &amp; expressions, ignorant of Sanscrit, of any language but his own provincial dialect, ignorant of philosophy &amp; science, ignorant of the world, yet realised in himself all the spiritual wisdom of the ages, shed in his brief sayings a light so full, so deep on the most difficult profundities of our inner being, the most abstruse questions of metaphysics that the most strenuous thinkers &amp; the most learned Pandits were impressed by his superiority. By what process did he arrive at this great store of living knowledge? Never by any intellectual process, by any steps of reasoning. In all the things of the intellect, even the most elementary, he was as simple as a child, more unsophisticated than the most ignorant peasant of his native village. He could turn indeed an eye of infallible keenness on the hearts &amp; intentions of men, but it was the eye of vision, not the eye of thought. Never indeed, in modern times or since the intellectualising of mankind began were reasoning &amp; intellectual processes so rigidly excluded from the process of knowledge with such astonishing results. The secret of his success was that always he lived &amp; saw; where most men only reason and translate thought into sentiment, feel and translate emotion into terms of thinking, he saw with the heart or a higher faculty &amp; threw out his vision into experience with a power of realisation of which modern men have long ceased to be capable; thus living everything to its full conclusion of mental &amp; physical experience his soul opened more &amp; more to knowledge, to direct truth, to the Satyam in things, until the depths hid nothing from him &amp; the heights became accessible to his tread. He first has shown us clearly, entirely &amp; without reserve or attenuating circumstance, the supreme importance of being over thinking, but being, not in terms of the body &amp; life merely, like the sensational &amp; emotional man or the man of action, but in the soul as well and the soul chiefly, in the central entity of this complex human symbol. Therefore he was able to liberate us from the chains imposed by the makeshifts of centuries. He broke through the limitations of the Yogic schools, practised each of them in turn &amp; would reach in three days the consummation which even to powerful Yogins is the accomplishment of decades or even of more lives than one; broke through the limitations of religion and fulfilled himself in experience as a worshipper of Christ and of Allah while all the time remaining in the individual part of him a Hindu of the sect of the Shaktas; broke through the limitations of the Guruparampara, &amp;, while using human teachers for outward process &amp; discipline, yet received his first &amp; supreme initiation from the eternal Mother herself and all his knowledge from the World-Teacher within; broke through the logical limitations of the metaphysical schools and showed us Dwaita &amp; Adwaita inextricably yet harmoniously one in experience, even as they are shown to us in Veda &amp; Vedanta. All that at the time still governed our spiritual life he took typically into his soul &amp; into his mental &amp; physical experience, swallowed up its defects &amp; imperfections in the infinite abyss of his personality and brought out through these masks &amp; forms always the something beyond that is perfect and supreme. Thus establishing experience and inward revelation as the supreme means of the highest knowledge, his became one of the seed-lives of humanity; and the seed it held was the loosening of the bonds of the rational intellect &amp; the return of humanity’s journey from its long detour on the mid-plateaus of reason towards the footpath that winds up to the summits of the spirit.” (<span class="ref-num _idGenCharOverride-1">588</span>-<span class="ref-num _idGenCharOverride-1">90</span>)</p>
