			<p class="body-text">“All existence is the existence of the Eternal, the Infinite, the Divine, the Ineffable – existence in Time no less than existence in Eternity, existence in the finite no less than existence in the Infinite, of the Many no less than of the One, of the Personal no less than of the Impersonal, of the individual and the cosmos no less than of the supercosmic, of the relative no less than of the Absolute. Ekam evadvitiyam Brahma. </p>
			<p class="body-text">The Eternal is in his very truth of being Existence, Consciousness and Bliss of existence. These three are a trinity and inseparable – they are not three but one; it is only in a certain play of the Manifestation that they can be distinguished and separated from each other or turned phenomenally into their opposites. What appears to us as Nonexistence (Asat, Nihil or Sunya) is only an existence other than the existence of which we are aware. What appears to us as Inconscience is only a veiled or involved consciousness or else a consciousness to which our mind or sense has no access. What affects us as pain or suffering is only Ananda turned against itself, a distorted and tortured Bliss of existence. These contradictions are real in the Ignorance and because of the Ignorance, but to the true consciousness they are only phenomenal and superficial, not true truths of being.” (<span class="ref-num _idGenCharOverride-1">187</span>-<span class="ref-num _idGenCharOverride-1">88</span>)</p>
