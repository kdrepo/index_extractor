			<p class="body-text">“Let us suppose that all historical documents, archives, records were destroyed or disappeared in the process of Time and the catastrophes of civilisation, and only the pure literature survived. Of how many nations should we have the very life, heart &amp; mind, the whole picture of its life &amp; civilisation and the story of its development adequately revealed in its best writing? Three European nations would survive immortally before the eyes of posterity, the ancient Greeks, the modern English and French, and two Asiatic nations, the Chinese &amp; the Hindus, – no others.</p>
			<p class="body-text">Of all these the Hindus have revealed themselves the most perfectly, continuously and on the most colossal scale, precisely because they have been the most indomitably original in the form &amp; matter of their literature. The <a id="_idIndexMarker014"></a><span class="Index-Entry">Vedas</span>, <a id="_idIndexMarker015"></a><span class="Index-Entry">Upanishads</span> &amp; <a id="_idIndexMarker016"></a><span class="Index-Entry">Puranas</span> are unique in their kind; the great <a id="_idIndexMarker017"></a><span class="Index-Entry">Epics</span> in their form and type of art stand apart in the epic literature of the world, the <a id="_idIndexMarker018"></a><span class="Index-Entry">old Sanscrit</span> <a id="_idIndexMarker019"></a><span class="Index-Entry">drama</span> has its affinities with a dramatic species which developed itself in Europe more than a thousand years later, and the literary epic follows laws of form and canons of art which are purely indigenous. And this immense body of first rate work has left us so intimate &amp; complete a revelation of national life &amp; history, that the absence of pure historical writings becomes a subject of merely conventional regret. The same intense originality and depth of self-expression are continued after the decline of the classical language in the national literatures of Maharashtra, Bengal &amp; the Hindi-speaking North.” (<span class="ref-num _idGenCharOverride-1">147</span>)</p>
