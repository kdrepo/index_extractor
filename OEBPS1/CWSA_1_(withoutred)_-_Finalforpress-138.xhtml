			<p class="body-text">“How many who have the religious faith and the religious temperament, are following the impulses of their heart, the cravings of their desire, the urgency of their senses, the dictates of their opinion when they fully imagine that their God is leading them! And they do well, for God is leading them. It is the way He has chosen for them, &amp; since He has chosen it, it is the best &amp; wisest &amp; most fruitful way for them. Still it is their God – not one they have made in their own image as the Atheist believes, but One who makes Himself in the image that they prefer, the image that best suits with their nature or their development. “In whatever way men come to me, in that way I love &amp; cleave to them.” It is a saying of fathomless depth which contains the seed of the whole truth about God &amp; religion. After all it is only in this way that the conditioned can meet the Absolute, that which has a nature or dharma of its own with that which is beyond all limit of nature or dharma. After the meeting of the soul with God, – well, that is a different matter. The secrets of His nuptial chamber cannot all be spoken.” (<span class="ref-num _idGenCharOverride-1">88</span>-<span class="ref-num _idGenCharOverride-1">89</span>)</p>
