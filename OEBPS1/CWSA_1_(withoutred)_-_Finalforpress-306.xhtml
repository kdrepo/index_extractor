			<p class="body-text">“As in absolute existence there can be no nothingness, no night of inconscience, no deficiency, that is to say, no failure of Force, – for if there were any of these things, it would not be absolute, – so also there can be no suffering, no negation of delight. Absoluteness of conscious existence is illimitable bliss of conscious existence; the two are only different phrases for the same thing. All illimitableness, all infinity, all absoluteness is pure delight.” (<span class="ref-num _idGenCharOverride-1">98</span>-<span class="ref-num _idGenCharOverride-1">99</span>)</p>
