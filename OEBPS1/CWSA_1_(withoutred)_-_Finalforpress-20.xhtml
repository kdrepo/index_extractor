			<h2 id="_idParaDest-21" class="SubHead1">Simultaneous and Successive Teaching*</h2>
			<p class="body-text">“A very remarkable feature of modern training which has been subjected in India to a reductio ad absurdum is the practice of <a id="_idIndexMarker157"></a><a id="_idIndexMarker158"></a>teaching by snippets. A subject is taught a little at a time, in conjunction with a host of others, with the result that what might be well learnt in a single year is badly learned in seven and the boy goes out ill-equipped, served with imperfect parcels of knowledge, master of none of the great departments of human knowledge. The system of <a id="_idIndexMarker159"></a><span class="Index-Entry">education</span> adopted by the National Council, an amphibious and twy-natured creation, attempts to heighten this practice of teaching by snippets...</p>
			<p class="body-text">We must have the courage to take up clearer knowledge and apply it fearlessly in the interests of posterity. Teaching by snippets must be relegated to the lumber-room of dead sorrows. The first work is to interest the child in life, work and knowledge, to develop his instruments of knowledge with the utmost thoroughness, to give him mastery of the medium he must use. Afterwards, the rapidity with which he will learn will make up for any delay in taking up regular studies, and it will be found that, where now he learns a few things badly, then he will learn many things thoroughly well.” (<span class="ref-num _idGenCharOverride-1">393</span>-<span class="ref-num _idGenCharOverride-1">96</span>)</p>
